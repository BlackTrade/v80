abstract: Backpropagation algorithm is indispensable for the training of feedforward
  neural networks. It requires propagating error gradients sequentially from the output
  layer all the way back to the input layer. The backward locking in backpropagation
  algorithm constrains us from updating network layers in parallel and fully leveraging
  the computing resources. Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for breaking
  the backward locking. However, their performances degrade seriously when networks
  are deep. In this paper, we propose decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm
  for deep learning optimization with convergence guarantee. Firstly, we decouple
  the backpropagation algorithm using delayed gradients, and show that the backward
  locking is removed when we split the networks into multiple modules. Then, we utilize
  decoupled parallel backpropagation in two stochastic methods and prove that our
  method guarantees convergence to critical points for the non-convex problem. Finally,
  we perform experiments for training deep convolutional neural networks on benchmark
  datasets. The experimental results not only confirm our theoretical analysis, but
  also demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significant speedup without
  loss of accuracy.
