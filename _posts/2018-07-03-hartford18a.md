abstract: 'We use deep learning to model interactions across two or more sets of objects,
  such as user{–}movie ratings or protein{–}drug bindings. The canonical representation
  of such interactions is a matrix (or tensor) with an exchangeability property: the
  encoding’s meaning is not changed by permuting rows or columns. We argue that models
  should hence be Permutation Equivariant (PE): constrained to make the same predictions
  across such permutations. We present a parameter-sharing scheme and prove that it
  is maximally expressive under the PE constraint. This scheme yields three benefits.
  First, we demonstrate performance competitive with the state of the art on multiple
  matrix completion benchmarks. Second, our models require a number of parameters
  independent of the numbers of objects and thus scale well to large datasets. Third,
  models can be queried about new objects that were not available at training time,
  but for which interactions have since been observed. We observed surprisingly good
  generalization performance on this matrix extrapolation task, both within domains
  (e.g., new users and new movies drawn from the same distribution used for training)
  and even across domains (e.g., predicting music ratings after training on movie
  ratings).'
