abstract: Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning require an agent
  to select optimal actions from continuous action spaces. Recently, deep neural networks
  have successfully been applied to games with discrete actions spaces. However, deep
  neural networks for discrete actions are not suitable for devising strategies for
  games in which a very small change in an action can dramatically affect the outcome.
  In this paper, we present a new framework which incorporates a deep neural network
  that can be used to learn game strategies based on a kernel-based Monte Carlo tree
  search that finds actions within a continuous space. To avoid hand-crafted features,
  we train our network using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning
  with a high-fidelity simulator for the Olympic sport of curling. The program trained
  under our framework outperforms existing programs equipped with several hand-crafted
  features and won an international digital curling competition.
