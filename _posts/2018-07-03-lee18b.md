abstract: Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning require an agent
  to select optimal actions from continuous spaces. Recently, deep neural networks
  have successfully been applied to games with discrete actions spaces. However, deep
  neural networks for discrete actions are not suitable for devising strategies for
  games where a very small change in an action can dramatically affect the outcome.
  In this paper, we present a new self-play reinforcement learning framework which
  equips a continuous search algorithm which enables to search in continuous action
  spaces with a kernel regression method. Without any hand-crafted features, our network
  is trained by supervised learning followed by self-play reinforcement learning with
  a high-fidelity simulator for the Olympic sport of curling. The program trained
  under our framework outperforms existing programs equipped with several hand-crafted
  features and won an international digital curling competition.
