abstract: Robust subspace tracking (RST) can be simply understood as a dynamic (time-varying)
  extension of robust PCA. More precisely, it is the problem of tracking data lying
  in a fixed or slowly-changing low-dimensional subspace while being robust to sparse
  outliers. This work develops a recursive projected compressive sensing algorithm
  called “Nearly Optimal RST (NORST)”, and obtains one of the first guarantees for
  it. We show that NORST provably solves RST under weakened standard RPCA assumptions,
  slow subspace change, and a lower bound on (most) outlier magnitudes. Our guarantee
  shows that (i) NORST is online (after initialization) and enjoys near-optimal values
  of tracking delay, lower bound on required delay between subspace change times,
  and of memory complexity; and (ii) it has a significantly improved worst-case outlier
  tolerance compared with all previous robust PCA or RST methods without requiring
  any model on how the outlier support is generated.
