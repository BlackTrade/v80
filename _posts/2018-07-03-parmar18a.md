abstract: Image generation has been successfully cast as an autoregressive sequence
  generation or transformation problem. Recent work has shown that self-attention
  is an effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize a
  recently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, to
  a sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood.
  By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we
  significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite
  maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional
  neural networks. While conceptually simple, our generative models significantly
  outperform the current state of the art in image generation on ImageNet, improving
  the best published negative log-likelihood on ImageNet from 3.83 to 3.77.We also
  present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying
  an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a human evaluation study,
  we find that images generated by our super-resolution model fool human observers
  three times more often than the previous state of the art.
