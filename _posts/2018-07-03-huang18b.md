abstract: We prove a <em>multi-channel telescoping sum boosting</em> theory for the
  ResNet architectures which simultaneously creates a new technique for boosting over
  features (in contrast with labels) and provides a new algorithm for ResNet-style
  architectures. Our proposed training algorithm, <em>BoostResNet</em>, is particularly
  suitable in non-differentiable architectures. Our method only requires the relatively
  inexpensive sequential training of $T$ “shallow ResNets”. We prove that the training
  error decays exponentially with the depth $T$ if the weak module classifiers that
  we train perform slightly better than some weak baseline. In other words, we propose
  a weak learning condition and prove a boosting theory for ResNet under the weak
  learning condition. A generalization error bound based on margin theory is proved
  and suggests that ResNet could be resistant to overfitting using a network with
  $l_1$ norm bounded weights.
