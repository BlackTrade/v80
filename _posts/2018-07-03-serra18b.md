abstract: We investigate the complexity of deep neural networks (DNN) that represent
  piecewise linear (PWL) functions. In particular, we study the number of linear regions,
  i.e. pieces, that a PWL function represented by a DNN can attain, both theoretically
  and empirically. We present (i) tighter upper and lower bounds for the maximum number
  of linear regions on rectifier networks, which are exact for inputs of dimension
  one; (ii) a first upper bound for multi-layer maxout networks; and (iii) a first
  method to perform exact enumeration or counting of the number of regions by modeling
  the DNN with a mixed-integer linear formulation. These bounds come from leveraging
  the dimension of the space defining each linear region. The results also indicate
  that a deep rectifier network can only have more linear regions than every shallow
  counterpart with same number of neurons if that number exceeds the dimension of
  the input.
