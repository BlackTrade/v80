abstract: In compressed sensing, a small number of linear measurements can be used
  to reconstruct an unknown signal. Existing approaches leverage assumptions on the
  structure of these signals, such as sparsity or the availability of a generative
  model. A domain-specific generative model can provide a stronger prior and thus
  allow for recovery with far fewer measurements. However, unlike sparsity-based approaches,
  existing methods based on generative models guarantee exact recovery only over their
  support, which is typically only a small subset of the space on which the signals
  are defined. We propose Sparse-Gen, a framework that allows for sparse deviations
  from the support set, thereby achieving the best of both worlds by using a domain
  specific prior and allowing reconstruction over the full space of signals. Theoretically,
  our framework provides a new class of signals that can be acquired using compressed
  sensing, reducing classic sparse vector recovery to a special case and avoiding
  the restrictive support due to a generative model prior. Empirically, we observe
  consistent improvements in reconstruction accuracy over competing approaches, especially
  in the more practical setting of transfer compressed sensing where a generative
  model for a data-rich, source domain aids sensing on a data-scarce, target domain.
