abstract: The ability to transfer skills across tasks has the potential to scale up
  reinforcement learning (RL) agents to environments currently out of reach. Recently,
  a framework based on two ideas, successor features (SFs) and generalised policy
  improvement (GPI), has been introduced as a principled way of transferring skills.
  In this paper we extend the SF&GPI framework in two ways. One of the basic assumptions
  underlying the original formulation of SF&GPI is that rewards for all tasks of interest
  can be computed as linear combinations of a fixed set of features. We relax this
  constraint and show that the theoretical guarantees supporting the framework can
  be extended to any set of tasks that only differ in the reward function. Our second
  contribution is to show that one can use the reward functions themselves as features
  for future tasks, without any loss of expressiveness, thus removing the need to
  specify a set of features beforehand. This makes it possible to combine SF&GPI with
  deep learning in a more stable way. We empirically verify this claim on a complex
  3D environment where observations are images from a first-person perspective. We
  show that the transfer promoted by SF&GPI leads to very good policies on unseen
  tasks almost instantaneously. We also describe how to learn policies specialised
  to the new tasks in a way that allows them to be added to the agentâ€™s set of skills,
  and thus be reused in the future.
