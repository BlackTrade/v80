abstract: Value Iteration Networks (VINs) are effective differentiable path planning
  modules that can be used by agents to perform navigation while still maintaining
  end-to-end differentiability of the entire architecture. Despite their effectiveness,
  they suffer from several disadvantages including training instability, random seed
  sensitivity, and other optimization problems. In this work, we reframe VINs as recurrent-convolutional
  networks which demonstrates that VINs couple recurrent convolutions with an unconventional
  max-pooling activation. From this perspective, we argue that standard gated recurrent
  update equations could potentially alleviate the optimization issues plaguing VIN.
  The resulting architecture, which we call the Gated Path Planning Network, is shown
  to empirically outperform VIN on a variety of metrics such as learning speed, hyperparameter
  sensitivity, iteration count, and even generalization. Furthermore, we show that
  this performance gap is consistent across different maze transition types, maze
  sizes and even show success on a challenging 3D environment, where the planner is
  only provided with first-person RGB images.
