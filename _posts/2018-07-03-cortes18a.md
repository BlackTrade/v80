abstract: We present an extensive study of a key problem in online learning where
  the learner can opt to abstain from making a prediction, at a certain cost. In the
  adversarial setting, we show how existing online algorithms and guarantees can be
  adapted to this problem. In the stochastic setting, we first point out a bias problem
  that limits the straightforward extension of algorithms such as UCB-N to this context.
  Next, we give a new algorithm, UCB-GT, that exploits historical data and time-varying
  feedback graphs. We show that this algorithm benefits from more favorable regret
  guarantees than a natural extension of UCB-N . We further report the results of
  a series of experiments demonstrating that UCB-GT largely outperforms that extension
  of UCB-N, as well as other standard baselines.
