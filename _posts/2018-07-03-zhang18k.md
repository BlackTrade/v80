abstract: The tasks that an agent will need to solve often are not known during training.
  However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment are important then,
  after learning how its actions affect those properties, it may be able to use this
  knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifically for them. Towards
  this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of
  user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a
  method that learns a policy for transitioning between “nearby” sets of attributes,
  and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can
  be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model
  infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute
  space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the
  plan. We show in 3D block stacking, grid-world games, and StarCraft that our model
  is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time by composing simpler
  learned policies.
