abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of trace-based supervision methods for
  training existing neural abstract machines. To define the class of neural machines
  amenable to trace-based supervision, we introduce the concept of a differential
  neural computational machine (dNCM) and show that several existing architectures
  (NTMs, NRAMs) can be described as dNCMs. We performed a detailed experimental evaluation
  with NTM and NRAM machines, showing that additional supervision on the interpretable
  portions of these architectures leads to better convergence and generalization capabilities
  of the learning phase than standard training, in both noise-free and noisy scenarios.
