abstract: 'Techniques for reducing the variance of gradient estimates used in stochastic
  programming algorithms for convex finite-sum problems have received a great deal
  of attention in recent years. By leveraging dissipativity theory from control, we
  provide a new perspective on two important variance-reduction algorithms: SVRG and
  its direct accelerated variant Katyusha. Our perspective provides a physically intuitive
  understanding of the behavior of SVRG-like methods via a principle of energy conservation.
  The tools discussed here allow us to automate the convergence analysis of SVRG-like
  methods by capturing their essential properties in small semidefinite programs amenable
  to standard analysis and computational techniques. Our approach recovers existing
  convergence results for SVRG and Katyusha and generalizes the theory to alternative
  parameter choices. We also discuss how our approach complements the linear coupling
  technique. Our combination of perspectives leads to a better understanding of accelerated
  variance-reduced stochastic methods for finite-sum problems.'
