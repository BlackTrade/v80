abstract: The Cox process is a flexible event model that can account for uncertainty
  of the intensity function in the Poisson process. However, previous approaches make
  strong assumptions in terms of time stationarity, potentially failing to generalize
  when the data do not conform to the assumed stationarity conditions. In this paper
  we bring up two most popular Cox models representing two extremes, and propose a
  novel semi-stationary Cox process model that can take benefits from both models.
  Our model has a set of Gaussian process latent functions governed by a latent stationary
  Markov process where we provide analytic derivations for the variational inference.
  Empirical evaluations on several synthetic and real-world events data including
  the football shot attempts and daily earthquakes, demonstrate that the proposed
  model is promising, can yield improved generalization performance over existing
  approaches.
