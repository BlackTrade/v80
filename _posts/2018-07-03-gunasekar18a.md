abstract: We study the bias of generic optimization methods, including Mirror Descent,
  Natural Gradient Descent and Steepest Descent with respect to different potentials
  and norms, when optimizing underdetermined linear models or separable linear classification
  problems. We ask the question of whether the global minimum (among the many possible
  global minima) reached by optimization can be characterized in terms of the potential
  or norm, and indecently of hyper-parameter choices, such as stepsize and momentum.
