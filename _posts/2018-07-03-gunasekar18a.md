abstract: We study the bias of generic optimization methods, including MirrorDescent,
  Natural Gradient Descent and Steepest Descent with respectto different potentials
  and norms, when optimizing underdeterminedlinear models or separable linear classification
  problems. We askthe question of whether the global minimum (among the many possibleglobal
  minima) reached by optimization can be characterized in termsof the potential or
  norm, and indecently of hyper-parameter choices,such as stepsize and momentum.
