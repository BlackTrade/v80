abstract: Training of discrete latent variable models remains challenging because
  passing gradient information through discrete units is difficult. We propose a new
  class of smoothing transformations based on a mixture of two overlapping distributions,
  and show that the proposed transformation can be used for training binary latent
  models with either directed or undirected priors. We derive a new variational bound
  to efficiently train with Boltzmann machine priors. Using this bound, we develop
  DVAE++, a generative model with a global discrete prior and a hierarchy of convolutional
  continuous variables. Experiments on several benchmarks show that overlapping transformations
  outperform other recent continuous relaxations of discrete latent variables including
  Gumbel-Softmax (Maddison et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2016), and discrete variational
  autoencoders (Rolfe 2016).
