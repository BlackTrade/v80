abstract: 'In machine learning, learning often corresponds to changing the parameters
  of a parameterized function. A learning rule is an algorithm or mathematical expression
  that specifies precisely how the parameters should be changed. When creating a machine
  learning system, we must make two decisions: what representation should be used
  (i.e., what parameterized function should be used) and what learning rule should
  be used to search through the resulting set of representable functions. In this
  paper we focus on gradient-like learning rules, wherein these two decisions are
  coupled in a subtle (and often unintentional) way. Using most learning rules, these
  two decisions are coupled in a subtle (and often unintentional) way. That is, using
  the same learning rule with two different representations that can represent the
  same sets of functions can result in two different outcomes. After arguing that
  this coupling is undesirable, particularly when using neural networks, we present
  a method for partially decoupling these two decisions for a broad class of gradient-like
  learning rules that span unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and supervised
  learning.'
