abstract: Embedding representation learning via neural networks is at the core foundation
  of modern similarity based search. While much effort has been put in developing
  algorithms for learning binary hamming code representations for search efficiency,
  this still requires a linear scan of the entire dataset per each query and trades
  off the search accuracy through binarization. To this end, we consider the problem
  of directly learning a quantizable embedding representation and the sparse binary
  hash code end-to-end which can be used to construct an efficient hash table not
  only providing significant search reduction in the number of data but also achieving
  the state of the art search accuracy outperforming previous state of the art deep
  metric learning methods. We also show that finding the optimal sparse binary hash
  code in a mini-batch can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a minimum
  cost flow problem. Our results on Cifar-100 and on ImageNet datasets show the state
  of the art search accuracy in precision@k and NMI metrics while providing up to
  98X and 478X search speedup respectively over exhaustive linear search. The source
  code is available at https://github.com/maestrojeong/Deep-Hash-Table-ICML18.
