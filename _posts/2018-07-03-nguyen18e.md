abstract: Existing algorithms for dictionary learning assume that the entries of the
  (high-dimensional) input data are fully observed. However, in several practical
  applications, only an incomplete fraction of the data entries may be available.
  For incomplete settings, no provably correct and polynomial-time algorithm has been
  reported in the dictionary learning literature. In this paper, we provide provable
  approaches for learning – from incomplete samples – a family of dictionaries whose
  atoms have sufficiently “spread-out” mass. First, we propose a descent-style iterative
  algorithm that linearly converges to the true dictionary when provided a sufficiently
  coarse initial estimate. Second, we propose an initialization algorithm that utilizes
  a small number of extra fully observed samples to produce such a coarse initial
  estimate. Finally, we theoretically analyze their performance and provide asymptotic
  statistical and computational guarantees.
