abstract: Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a widely used algorithm for recovering
  sparse high dimensional vectors in linear regression models. The optimal performance
  of OMP requires a priori knowledge of either the sparsity of regression vector or
  noise statistics. Both these statistics are rarely known a priori and are very difficult
  to estimate. In this paper, we present a novel technique called residual ratio thresholding
  (RRT) to operate OMP without any a priori knowledge of sparsity and noise statistics
  and establish finite sample and large sample support recovery guarantees for the
  same. Both analytical results and numerical simulations in real and synthetic data
  sets indicate that RRT has a performance comparable to OMP with a priori knowledge
  of sparsity and noise statistics.
