abstract: For data-driven decision-making, one promising approach, called predictive
  optimization, is to solve maximization problems i n which the objective function
  to be maximized is estimated from data. Predictive optimization, however, suffers
  from the problem of a calculated optimal solutionâ€™s being evaluated too optimistically,
  i.e., the value of the objective function is overestimated. This paper investigates
  such optimistic bias and presents two methods for correcting it. The first, which
  is analogous to cross-validation, successfully corrects the optimistic bias but
  results in underestimation of the true value. Our second method employs resampling
  techniques to avoid both overestimation and underestimation. We show that the second
  method, referred to as the parameter perturbation method, achieves asymptotically
  unbiased estimation. Empirical results for both artificial and real-world datasets
  demonstrate that our proposed approach successfully corrects the optimistic bias.
