abstract: 'Block-coordinate descent algorithms and alternating minimization methods
  are fundamental optimization algorithms and an important primitive in large-scale
  optimization and machine learning. While various block-coordinate-descent-type methods
  have been studied extensively, only alternating minimization – which applies to
  the setting of only two blocks – is known to have convergence time that scales independently
  of the least smooth block. A natural question is then: is the setting of two blocks
  special? We show that the answer is “no” as long as the least smooth block can be
  optimized exactly – an assumption that is also needed in the setting of alternating
  minimization. We do so by introducing a novel algorithm AR-BCD, whose convergence
  time scales independently of the least smooth (possibly non-smooth) block. The basic
  algorithm generalizes both alternating minimization and randomized block coordinate
  (gradient) descent, and we also provide its accelerated version – AAR-BCD.'
