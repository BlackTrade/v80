abstract: Many graph analytics problems can be solved via iterative algorithms where
  the solutions are often characterized by a set of steady-state conditions. Different
  algorithms respect to different set of fixed point constraints, so instead of using
  these traditional algorithms, can we learn an algorithm which can obtain the same
  steady-state solutions automatically from examples, in an effective and scalable
  way? How to represent the meta learner for such algorithm and how to carry out the
  learning? In this paper, we propose an embedding representation for iterative algorithms
  over graphs, and design a learning method which alternates between updating the
  embeddings and projecting them onto the steady-state constraints. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our framework using a few commonly used graph algorithms, and
  show that in some cases, the learned algorithm can handle graphs with more than
  100,000,000 nodes in a single machine.
