abstract: Modeling and generating graphs is fundamental for studying networks in biology,
  engineering, and social sciences. However, modeling complex distributions over graphs
  and then efficiently sampling from these distributions is challenging due to the
  non-unique, high-dimensional nature of graphs and the complex, non-local dependencies
  that exist between edges in a given graph. Here we propose GraphRNN, a deep autoregressive
  model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs
  with minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs
  by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation
  process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure
  generated so far. In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of GraphRNN,
  we introduce a benchmark suite of datasets, baselines and novel evaluation metrics
  based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy, which measure distances between sets of graphs.
  Our experiments show that GraphRNN significantly outperforms all baselines, learning
  to generate diverse graphs that match the structural characteristics of a target
  set, while also scaling to graphs 50 times larger than previous deep models.
