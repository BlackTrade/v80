abstract: In this work, we propose “global style tokens” (GSTs), a bank of embeddings
  that are jointly trained within Tacotron, a state-of-the-art end-to-end speech synthesis
  system. The embeddings are trained with no explicit labels, yet learn to model a
  large range of acoustic expressiveness. GSTs lead to a rich set of significant results.
  The soft interpretable “labels” they generate can be used to control synthesis in
  novel ways, such as varying speed and speaking style – independently of the text
  content. They can also be used for style transfer, replicating the speaking style
  of a single audio clip across an entire long-form text corpus. When trained on noisy,
  unlabeled found data, GSTs learn to factorize noise and speaker identity, providing
  a path towards highly scalable but robust speech synthesis.
