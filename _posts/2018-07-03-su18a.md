abstract: Low-dimensional discriminative representations enhance machine learning
  methods in both performance and complexity, motivating supervised dimensionality
  reduction (DR) that transforms high-dimensional data to a discriminative subspace.
  Most DR methods require data to be i.i.d., however, in some domains, data naturally
  come in sequences, where the observations are temporally correlated. We propose
  a DR method called LT-LDA to learn low-dimensional temporal representations. We
  construct the separability among sequence classes by lifting the holistic temporal
  structures, which are established based on temporal alignments and may change in
  different subspaces. We jointly learn the subspace and the associated alignments
  by optimizing an objective which favors easily-separable temporal structures, and
  show that this objective is connected to the inference of alignments, thus allows
  an iterative solution. We provide both theoretical insight and empirical evaluation
  on real-world sequence datasets to show the interest of our method.
