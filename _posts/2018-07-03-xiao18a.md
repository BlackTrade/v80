abstract: In recent years, state-of-the-art methods in computer vision have utilized
  increasingly deep convolutional neural network architectures (CNNs), with some of
  the most successful models employing hundreds or even thousands of layers. A variety
  of pathologies such as vanishing/exploding gradients make training such deep networks
  challenging. While residual connections and batch normalization do enable training
  at these depths, it has remained unclear whether such specialized architecture designs
  are truly necessary to train deep CNNs. In this work, we demonstrate that it is
  possible to train vanilla CNNs with ten thousand layers or more simply by using
  an appropriate initialization scheme. We derive this initialization scheme theoretically
  by developing a mean field theory for signal propagation and by characterizing the
  conditions for dynamical isometry, the equilibration of singular values of the input-output
  Jacobian matrix. These conditions require that the convolution operator be an orthogonal
  transformation in the sense that it is norm-preserving. We present an algorithm
  for generating such random initial orthogonal convolution kernels and demonstrate
  empirically that they enable efficient training of extremely deep architectures.
