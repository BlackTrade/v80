abstract: When function approximation is used, solving the Bellman optimality equation
  with stability guarantees has remained a major open problem in reinforcement learning
  for decades. The fundamental difficulty is that the Bellman operator may become
  an expansion in general, resulting in oscillating and even divergent behavior of
  popular algorithms like Q-learning. In this paper, we revisit the Bellman equation,
  and reformulate it into a novel primal-dual optimization problem using Nesterov’s
  smoothing technique and the Legendre-Fenchel transformation. We then develop a new
  algorithm, called Smoothed Bellman Error Embedding, to solve this optimization problem
  where any differentiable function class may be used. We provide what we believe
  to be the first convergence guarantee for general nonlinear function approximation,
  and analyze the algorithm’s sample complexity. Empirically, our algorithm compares
  favorably to state-of-the-art baselines in several benchmark control problems.
