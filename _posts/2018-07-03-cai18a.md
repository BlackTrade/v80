abstract: We introduce a new function-preserving transformation for efficient neural
  architecture search. This network transformation allows reusing previously trained
  networks and existing successful architectures that improves sample efficiency.
  We aim to address the limitation of current network transformation operations that
  can only perform layer-level architecture modifications, such as adding (pruning)
  filters or inserting (removing) a layer, which fails to change the topology of connection
  paths. Our proposed path-level transformation operations enable the meta-controller
  to modify the path topology of the given network while keeping the merits of reusing
  weights, and thus allow efficiently designing effective structures with complex
  path topologies like Inception models. We further propose a bidirectional tree-structured
  reinforcement learning meta-controller to explore a simple yet highly expressive
  tree-structured architecture space that can be viewed as a generalization of multi-branch
  architectures. We experimented on the image classification datasets with limited
  computational resources (about 200 GPU-hours), where we observed improved parameter
  efficiency and better test results (97.70% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 14.3M
  parameters and 74.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in the mobile setting), demonstrating
  the effectiveness and transferability of our designed architectures.
