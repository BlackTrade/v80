abstract: 'Training deep neural networks (DNNs) requires an increasing amount of computation
  resources, and it becomes typical to use a mixture of GPU and CPU devices. Due to
  the heterogeneity of these devices, a recent challenge is how each operation in
  a neural network can be optimally placed on these devices, so that the training
  process can take the shortest amount of time possible. The current state-of-the-art
  solution uses reinforcement learning based on the policy gradient method, and it
  suffers from suboptimal training times. In this paper, we propose Spotlight, a new
  reinforcement learning algorithm based on proximal policy optimization, designed
  specifically for finding an optimal device placement for training DNNs. The design
  of our new algorithm relies upon a new model of the device placement problem: by
  modeling it as a Markov decision process with multiple stages, we are able to prove
  that Spotlight achieves a theoretical guarantee on performance improvements. We
  have implemented Spotlight in the CIFAR-10 benchmark and deployed it on the Google
  Cloud platform. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the training time with
  placements recommended by Spotlight is 60.9% of that recommended by the policy gradient
  method.'
