abstract: Researchers have applied deep neural networks to image restoration tasks,
  in which they proposed various network architectures, loss functions, and training
  methods. In particular, adversarial training, which is employed in recent studies,
  seems to be a key ingredient to success. In this paper, we show that simple convolutional
  autoencoders (CAEs) built upon only standard network components, i.e., convolutional
  layers and skip connections, can outperform the state-of-the-art methods which employ
  adversarial training and sophisticated loss functions. The secret is to search for
  good architectures using an evolutionary algorithm. All we did was to train the
  optimized CAEs by minimizing the l2 loss between reconstructed images and their
  ground truths using the ADAM optimizer. Our experimental results show that this
  approach achieves 27.8 dB peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) on the CelebA dataset
  and 33.3 dB on the SVHN dataset, compared to 22.8 dB and 19.0 dB provided by the
  former state-of-the-art methods, respectively.
