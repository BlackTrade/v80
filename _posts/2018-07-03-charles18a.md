abstract: We establish novel generalization bounds for learning algorithms that converge
  to global minima. We derive black-box stability results that only depend on the
  convergence of a learning algorithm and the geometry around the minimizers of the
  empirical risk function. The results are shown for non-convex loss functions satisfying
  the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) and the quadratic growth (QG) conditions, which we show
  arise for 1-layer neural networks with leaky ReLU activations and deep neural networks
  with linear activations. We use our results to establish the stability of first-order
  methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient descent (GD), randomized
  coordinate descent (RCD), and the stochastic variance reduced gradient method (SVRG),
  in both the PL and the strongly convex setting. Our results match or improve state-of-the-art
  generalization bounds and can easily extend to similar optimization algorithms.
  Finally, although our results imply comparable stability for SGD and GD in the PL
  setting, we show that there exist simple quadratic models with multiple local minima
  where SGD is stable but GD is not.
