abstract: 'We observe that gradients computed via the reparameterization trick are
  in direct correspondence with solutions of the transport equation in the formalism
  of optimal transport. We use this perspective to compute (approximate) pathwise
  gradients for probability distributions not directly amenable to the reparameterization
  trick: Gamma, Beta, and Dirichlet. We further observe that when the reparameterization
  trick is applied to the Cholesky-factorized multivariate Normal distribution, the
  resulting gradients are suboptimal in the sense of optimal transport. We derive
  the optimal gradients and show that they have reduced variance in a Gaussian Process
  regression task. We demonstrate with a variety of synthetic experiments and stochastic
  variational inference tasks that our pathwise gradients are competitive with other
  methods.'
