abstract: 'Autoregressive generative models achieve the best results in density estimation
  tasks involving high dimensional data, such as images or audio. They pose density
  estimation as a sequence modeling task, where a recurrent neural network (RNN) models
  the conditional distribution over the next element conditioned on all previous elements.
  In this paradigm, the bottleneck is the extent to which the RNN can model long-range
  dependencies, and the most successful approaches rely on causal convolutions. Taking
  inspiration from recent work in meta reinforcement learning, where dealing with
  long-range dependencies is also essential, we introduce a new generative model architecture
  that combines causal convolutions with self attention. In this paper, we describe
  the resulting model and present state-of-the-art log-likelihood results on heavily
  benchmarked datasets: CIFAR-10, $32 \times 32$ ImageNet and $64 \times 64$ ImageNet.
  Our implementation will be made available at \url{https://github.com/neocxi/pixelsnail-public}.'
