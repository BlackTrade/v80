abstract: Future predictions on sequence data (e.g., videos or audios) require the
  algorithms to capture non-Markovian and compositional properties of high-level semantics.
  Context-free grammars are natural choices to capture such properties, but traditional
  grammar parsers (e.g., Earley parser) only take symbolic sentences as inputs. In
  this paper, we generalize the Earley parser to parse sequence data which is neither
  segmented nor labeled. This generalized Earley parser integrates a grammar parser
  with a classifier to find the optimal segmentation and labels, and makes top-down
  future predictions. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other
  approaches for future human activity prediction.
