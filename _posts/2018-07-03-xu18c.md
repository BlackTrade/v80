abstract: Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow
  a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these
  models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of "neighboring"
  nodes that a node’s representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure,
  analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties
  and tasks, we explore an architecture – jumping knowledge (JK) networks – that flexibly
  leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware
  representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation
  networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore,
  combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE
  and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models’ performance.
