abstract: Many problems in machine learning and statistics involve nested expectations
  and thus do not permit conventional Monte Carlo (MC) estimation. For such problems,
  one must nest estimators, such that terms in an outer estimator themselves involve
  calculation of a separate, nested, estimation. We investigate the statistical implications
  of nesting MC estimators, including cases of multiple levels of nesting, and establish
  the conditions under which they converge. We derive corresponding rates of convergence
  and provide empirical evidence that these rates are observed in practice. We further
  establish a number of pitfalls that can arise from naive nesting of MC estimators,
  provide guidelines about how these can be avoided, and lay out novel methods for
  reformulating certain classes of nested expectation problems into single expectations,
  leading to improved convergence rates. We demonstrate the applicability of our work
  by using our results to develop a new estimator for discrete Bayesian experimental
  design problems and derive error bounds for a class of variational objectives.
