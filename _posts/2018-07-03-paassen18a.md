abstract: Metric learning has the aim to improve classification accuracy by learning
  a distance measure which brings data points from the same class closer together
  and pushes data points from different classes further apart. Recent research has
  demonstrated that metric learning approaches can also be applied to trees, such
  as molecular structures, abstract syntax trees of computer programs, or syntax trees
  of natural language, by learning the cost function of an edit distance, i.e. the
  costs of replacing, deleting, or inserting nodes in a tree.However, learning such
  costs directly may yield an edit distance which violates metric axioms, is challenging
  to interpret, and may not generalize well.In this contribution, we propose a novel
  metric learning approach for trees which learns an edit distance indirectly by embedding
  the tree nodes as vectors, such that the Euclidean distance between those vectors
  supports class discrimination. We learn such embeddings by reducing the distance
  to prototypical trees from the same class and increasing the distance to prototypical
  trees from different classes.In our experiments, we show that our proposed metric
  learning approach improves upon the state-of-the-art in metric learning for trees
  on six benchmark data sets, ranging from computer science over biomedical data to
  a natural-language processing data set containing over 300,000 nodes.
