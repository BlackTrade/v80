abstract: Hyperbolic embeddings offer excellent quality with few dimensions when embedding
  hierarchical data structures. We give a combinatorial construction that embeds trees
  into hyperbolic space with arbitrarily low distortion without optimization. On WordNet,
  this algorithm obtains a mean-average-precision of 0.989 with only two dimensions,
  outperforming existing work by 0.11 points. We provide bounds characterizing the
  precision-dimensionality tradeoff inherent in any hyperbolic embedding. To embed
  general metric spaces, we propose a hyperbolic generalization of multidimensional
  scaling (h-MDS). We show how to perform exact recovery of hyperbolic points from
  distances, provide a perturbation analysis, and give a recovery result that enables
  us to reduce dimensionality. Finally, we extract lessons from the algorithms and
  theory above to design a scalable PyTorch-based implementation that can handle incomplete
  information.
