abstract: We propose temporal Poisson square root graphical models (TPSQRs), a generalization
  of Poisson square root graphical models (PSQRs) specifically designed for modeling
  longitudinal event data. By estimating the temporal relationships for all possible
  pairs of event types, TPSQRs can offer a holistic perspective about whether the
  occurrences of any given event type could excite or inhibit any other type. A TPSQR
  is learned by estimating a collection of interrelated PSQRs that share the same
  template parameterization. These PSQRs are estimated jointly in a pseudo-likelihood
  fashion, where Poisson pseudo-likelihood is used to approximate the original more
  computationally intensive pseudo-likelihood problem stemming from PSQRs. Theoretically,
  we demonstrate that under mild assumptions, the Poisson pseudolikelihood approximation
  is sparsistent for recovering the underlying PSQR. Empirically, we learn TPSQRs
  from a real-world large-scale electronic health record (EHR) with millions of drug
  prescription and condition diagnosis events, for adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the learned TPSQRs can recover ADR signals
  from the EHR effectively and efficiently.
