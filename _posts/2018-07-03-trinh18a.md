abstract: Despite recent advances in training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), capturing
  long-term dependencies in sequences remains a fundamental challenge. Most approaches
  use backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is difficult to scale to very long
  sequences. This paper proposes a simple method that improves the ability to capture
  long term dependencies in RNNs by adding an unsupervised auxiliary loss to the original
  objective. This auxiliary loss forces RNNs to either reconstruct previous events
  or predict next events in a sequence, making truncated backpropagation feasible
  for long sequences and also improving full BPTT. We evaluate our method on a variety
  of settings, including pixel-by-pixel image classification with sequence lengths
  up to 16000, and a real document classification benchmark. Our results highlight
  good performance and resource efficiency of this approach over competitive baselines,
  including other recurrent models and a comparable sized Transformer. Further analyses
  reveal beneficial effects of the auxiliary loss on optimization and regularization,
  as well as extreme cases where there is little to no backpropagation.
