abstract: Deep learning on graph structures has shown exciting results in various
  applications. However, few attentions have been paid to the robustness of such models,
  in contrast to numerous research work for image or text adversarial attack and defense.
  In this paper, we focus on the adversarial attacks that fool deep learning models
  by modifying the combinatorial structure of data. We first propose a reinforcement
  learning based attack method that learns the generalizable attack policy, while
  only requiring prediction labels from the target classifier. We further propose
  attack methods based on genetic algorithms and gradient descent in the scenario
  where additional prediction confidence or gradients are available. We use both synthetic
  and real-world data to show that, a family of Graph Neural Network models are vulnerable
  to these attacks, in both graph-level and node-level classification tasks. We also
  show such attacks can be used to diagnose the learned classifiers.
