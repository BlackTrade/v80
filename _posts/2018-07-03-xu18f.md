abstract: Divide-and-conquer is a powerful approach for large and massive data analysis.
  In the nonparameteric regression setting, although various theoretical frameworks
  have been established to achieve optimality in estimation or hypothesis testing,
  how to choose the tuning parameter in a practically effective way is still an open
  problem. In this paper, we propose a data-driven procedure based on divide-and-conquer
  for selecting the tuning parameters in kernel ridge regression by modifying the
  popular Generalized Cross-validation (GCV, Wahba, 1990). While the proposed criterion
  is computationally scalable for massive data sets, it is also shown under mild conditions
  to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that minimizing the proposed distributed-GCV
  (dGCV) criterion is equivalent to minimizing the true global conditional empirical
  loss of the averaged function estimator, extending the existing optimality results
  of GCV to the divide-and-conquer framework.
