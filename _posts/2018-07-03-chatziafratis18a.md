abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a popular unsuperviseddata analysis method. For
  many real-world applications,we would like to exploit prior informationabout the
  data that imposes constraintson the clustering hierarchy, and is not capturedby
  the set of features available to the algorithm.This gives rise to the problem of
  hierarchicalclustering with structural constraints. Structuralconstraints pose major
  challenges for bottom-upapproaches like average/single linkage and eventhough they
  can be naturally incorporated intotop-down divisive algorithms, no formal guaranteesexist
  on the quality of their output. In thispaper, we provide provable approximation
  guaranteesfor two simple top-down algorithms, usinga recently introduced optimization
  viewpoint ofhierarchical clustering with pairwise similarity information(Dasgupta,
  2016). We show how to findgood solutions even in the presence of conflictingprior
  information, by formulating a constraint-basedregularization of the objective. Furthemore,
  weexplore a variation of this objective for dissimilarityinformation (Cohen-Addad
  et al., 2018) andimprove upon current techniques. Finally, we demonstrate our approach
  on a real dataset for the taxonomy application.
