abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a popular unsupervised data analysis method.
  For many real-world applications, we would like to exploit prior information about
  the data that imposes constraints on the clustering hierarchy, and is not captured
  by the set of features available to the algorithm. This gives rise to the problem
  of hierarchical clustering with structural constraints. Structural constraints pose
  major challenges for bottom-up approaches like average/single linkage and even though
  they can be naturally incorporated into top-down divisive algorithms, no formal
  guarantees exist on the quality of their output. In this paper, we provide provable
  approximation guarantees for two simple top-down algorithms, using a recently introduced
  optimization viewpoint of hierarchical clustering with pairwise similarity information
  (Dasgupta, 2016). We show how to find good solutions even in the presence of conflicting
  prior information, by formulating a constraint-based regularization of the objective.
  Furthemore, we explore a variation of this objective for dissimilarity information
  (Cohen-Addad et al., 2018) and improve upon current techniques. Finally, we demonstrate
  our approach on a real dataset for the taxonomy application.
