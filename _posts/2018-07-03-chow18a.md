abstract: We study the sparse entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (ERL) problem
  in which the entropy term is a special form of the Tsallis entropy. The optimal
  policy of this formulation is sparse, i.e., at each state, it has non-zero probability
  for only a small number of actions. This addresses the main drawback of the standard
  Shannon entropy-regularized RL (soft ERL) formulation, in which the optimal policy
  is softmax, and thus, may assign a non-negligible probability mass to non-optimal
  actions. This problem is aggravated as the number of actions is increased. In this
  paper, we follow the work of Nachum et al. (2017) in the soft ERL setting, and propose
  a class of novel path consistency learning (PCL) algorithms, called sparse PCL,
  for the sparse ERL problem that can work with both on-policy and off-policy data.
  We first derive a sparse consistency equation that specifies a relationship between
  the optimal value function and policy of the sparse ERL along any system trajectory.
  Crucially, a weak form of the converse is also true, and we quantify the sub-optimality
  of a policy which satisfies sparse consistency, and show that as we increase the
  number of actions, this sub-optimality is better than that of the soft ERL optimal
  policy. We then use this result to derive the sparse PCL algorithms. We empirically
  compare sparse PCL with its soft counterpart, and show its advantage, especially
  in problems with a large number of actions.
