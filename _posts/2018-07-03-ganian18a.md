abstract: We consider two matrix completion problems, in which we are given a matrix
  with missing entries and the task is to complete the matrix in a way that (1) minimizes
  the rank, or (2) minimizes the number of distinct rows. We study the parameterized
  complexity of the two aforementioned problems with respect to several parameters
  of interest, including the minimum number of matrix rows, columns, and rows plus
  columns needed to cover all missing entries. We obtain new algorithmic results showing
  that, for the bounded domain case, both problems are fixed-parameter tractable with
  respect to all aforementioned parameters. We complement these results with a lower-bound
  result for the unbounded domain case that rules out fixed-parameter tractability
  w.r.t. some of the parameters under consideration.
