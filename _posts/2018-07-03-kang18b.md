abstract: Sign random projections (SRP) is a technique which allows the user to quickly
  estimate the angular similarity and inner products between data. We propose using
  additional information to improve these estimates which is easy to implement and
  cost efficient. We prove that the variance of our estimator is lower than the variance
  of SRP. Our proposed method can also be used together with other modifications of
  SRP, such as Super-Bit LSH (SBLSH). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
  on the MNIST test dataset and the Gisette dataset. We discuss how our proposed method
  can be extended to random projections or even other hashing algorithms.
