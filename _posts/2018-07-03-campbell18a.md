abstract: Coherent uncertainty quantification is a key strength of Bayesian methods.
  But modern algorithms for approximate Bayesian posterior inference often sacrifice
  accurate posterior uncertainty estimation in the pursuit of scalability. This work
  shows that previous Bayesian coreset construction algorithms—which build a small,
  weighted subset of the data that approximates the full dataset—are no exception.
  We demonstrate that these algorithms scale the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally,
  resulting in underestimated posterior uncertainty. To address this shortcoming,
  we develop greedy iterative geodesic ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian
  coreset construction that scales the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides
  geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size,
  and maintains the fast running time of its predecessors. The paper concludes with
  validation of GIGA on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it reduces
  posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude compared with previous coreset
  constructions.
