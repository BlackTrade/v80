abstract: 'We present a framework to compose artificial neural networks in cases where
  the data cannot be treated as independent events. Our particular motivation is star
  galaxy classification for ground based optical surveys. Due to a turbulent atmosphere
  and imperfect instruments, a single image of an astronomical object is not enough
  to definitively classify it as a star or galaxy. Instead the context of the surrounding
  objects imaged at the same time need to be considered in order to make an optimal
  classification. The model we present is divided into three distinct ANNs: one designed
  to capture local features about each object, the second to compare these features
  across all objects in an image, and the third to make a final prediction for each
  object based on the local and compared features. By exploiting the ability to replicate
  the weights of an ANN, the model can handle an arbitrary and variable number of
  individual objects embedded in a larger exposure. We train and test our model on
  simulations of a large up and coming ground based survey, the Large Synoptic Survey
  Telescope (LSST). We compare to the state of the art approach, showing improved
  overall performance as well as better performance for a specific class of objects
  that is important for the LSST.'
