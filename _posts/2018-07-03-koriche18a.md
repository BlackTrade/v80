abstract: In online optimization, the goal is to iteratively choose solutions from
  a decision space, so as to minimize the average cost over time. As long as this
  decision space is described by combinatorial constraints, the problem is generally
  intractable. In this paper, we consider the paradigm of compiling the set of combinatorial
  constraints into a deterministic and Decomposable Negation Normal Form (dDNNF) circuit,
  for which the tasks of linear optimization and solution sampling take linear time.
  Based on this framework, we provide efficient characterizations of existing combinatorial
  prediction strategies, with a particular attention to mirror descent techniques.
  These strategies are compared on several real-world benchmarks for which the set
  of Boolean constraints is preliminarily compiled into a dDNNF circuit.
