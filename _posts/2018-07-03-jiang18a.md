abstract: Inspired by recent successes of Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) in a number
  of artificial intelligence (AI) application domains, we propose a reinforcement
  learning (RL) technique that iteratively applies MCTS on batches of small, finite-horizon
  versions of the original infinite-horizon Markov decision process. The terminal
  condition of the finite-horizon problems, or the leaf-node evaluator of the decision
  tree generated by MCTS, is specified using a combination of an estimated value function
  and an estimated policy function. The recommendations generated by the MCTS procedure
  are then provided as feedback in order to refine, through classification and regression,
  the leaf-node evaluator for the next iteration. We provide the first sample complexity
  bounds for a tree search-based RL algorithm. In addition, we show that a deep neural
  network implementation of the technique can create a competitive AI agent for the
  popular multi-player online battle arena (MOBA) game King of Glory.
