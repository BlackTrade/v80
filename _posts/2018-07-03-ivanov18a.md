abstract: The task of representing entire graphs has seen a surge of prominent results,
  mainly due to learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graph-structured
  data. While CNNs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in graph classification
  task, such methods are supervised and therefore steer away from the original problem
  of network representation in task-agnostic manner. Here, we coherently propose an
  approach for embedding entire graphs and show that our feature representations with
  SVM classifier increase classification accuracy of CNN algorithms and traditional
  graph kernels. For this we describe a recently discovered graph object, <em>anonymous
  walk</em>, on which we design task-independent algorithms for learning graph representations
  in explicit and distributed way. Overall, our work represents a new scalable unsupervised
  learning of state-of-the-art representations of entire graphs.
