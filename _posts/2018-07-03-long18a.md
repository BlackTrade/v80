abstract: 'Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a prominent role in many disciplines
  of science and engineering. PDEs are commonly derived based on empirical observations.
  However, with the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage
  in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently
  stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery
  of physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in
  deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill
  two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems
  and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. Comparing with existing approaches,
  our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and
  the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. A special feature of
  the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables
  us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive
  and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by
  fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the
  orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory).
  Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden
  PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively
  long time, even in a noisy environment.'
