abstract: We investigate regularized algorithms combining with projection for least-squares
  regression problem over a Hilbert space, covering nonparametric regression over
  a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We prove convergence results with respect to
  variants of norms, under a capacity assumption on the hypothesis space and a regularity
  condition on the target function. As a result, we obtain optimal rates for regularized
  algorithms with randomized sketches, provided that the sketch dimension is proportional
  to the effective dimension up to a logarithmic factor. As a byproduct, we obtain
  similar results for Nyström regularized algorithms. Our results provide optimal,
  distribution-dependent rates for sketched/Nyström regularized algorithms, considering
  both the attainable and non-attainable cases.
