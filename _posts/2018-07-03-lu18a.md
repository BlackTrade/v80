abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem of inferring the existence of combinatorial
  structures in undirected graphical models. Although there exist extensive studies
  on the information-theoretic limits of this problem, it remains largely unexplored
  whether such limits can be attained by efficient algorithms. In this paper, we quantify
  the minimum computational complexity required to attain the information-theoretic
  limits based on an oracle computational model. We prove that, for testing common
  combinatorial structures, such as clique, nearest neighbor graph and perfect matching,
  against an empty graph, or large clique against small clique, the information-theoretic
  limits are provably unachievable by tractable algorithms in general. More importantly,
  we define structural quantities called the weak and strong edge densities, which
  offer deep insight into the existence of such computational-statistical tradeoffs.
  To the best of our knowledge, our characterization is the first to identify and
  explain the fundamental tradeoffs between statistics and computation for combinatorial
  inference problems in undirected graphical models.
