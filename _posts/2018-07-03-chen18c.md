abstract: Online optimization has been a successful framework for solving large-scale
  problems under computational constraints and partial information. Current methods
  for online convex optimization require either a projection or exact gradient computation
  at each step, both of which can be prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications.
  At the same time, there is a growing trend of non-convex optimization in machine
  learning community and a need for online methods. Continuous DR-submodular functions,
  which exhibit a natural diminishing returns condition, have recently been proposed
  as a broad class of non-convex functions which may be efficiently optimized. Although
  online methods have been introduced, they suffer from similar problems. In this
  work, we propose Meta-Frank-Wolfe, the first online projection-free algorithm that
  uses stochastic gradient estimates. The algorithm relies on a careful sampling of
  gradients in each round and achieves the optimal $O( \sqrt{T})$ adversarial regret
  bounds for convex and continuous submodular optimization. We also propose One-Shot
  Frank-Wolfe, a simpler algorithm which requires only a single stochastic gradient
  estimate in each round and achieves an $O(T^{2/3})$ stochastic regret bound for
  convex and continuous submodular optimization. We apply our methods to develop a
  novel "lifting" framework for the online discrete submodular maximization and also
  see that they outperform current state-of-the-art techniques on various experiments.
