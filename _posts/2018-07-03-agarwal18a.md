abstract: We present a systematic approach for achieving fairness in a binary classification
  setting. While we focus on two well-known quantitative definitions of fairness,
  our approach encompasses many other previously studied definitions as special cases.
  The key idea is to reduce fair classification to a sequence of cost-sensitive classification
  problems, whose solutions yield a randomized classifier with the lowest (empirical)
  error subject to the desired constraints. We introduce two reductions that work
  for any representation of the cost-sensitive classifier and compare favorably to
  prior baselines on a variety of data sets, while overcoming several of their disadvantages.
