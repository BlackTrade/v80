abstract: We introduce autoregressive implicit quantile networks (AIQN), a fundamentally
  different approach to generative modeling than those commonly used, that implicitly
  captures the distribution using quantile regression. AIQN is able to achieve superior
  perceptual quality and improvements in evaluation metrics, without incurring a loss
  of sample diversity. The method can be applied to many existing models and architectures.
  In this work we extend the PixelCNN model with AIQN and demonstrate results on CIFAR-10
  and ImageNet using Inception scores, FID, non-cherry-picked samples, and inpainting
  results. We consistently observe that AIQN yields a highly stable algorithm that
  improves perceptual quality while maintaining a highly diverse distribution.
