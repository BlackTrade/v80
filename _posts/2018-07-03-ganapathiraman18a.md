abstract: Latent prediction models, exemplified by multi-layer networks, employ hidden
  variables that automate abstract feature discovery. They typically pose nonconvex
  optimization problems and effective semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations
  have been developed to enable global solutions (Aslan et al., 2014).However, these
  models rely on nonparametric training of layer-wise kernel representations, and
  are therefore restricted to transductive learning which slows down test prediction.
  In this paper, we develop a new inductive learning framework for parametric transfer
  functions using matching losses. The result for ReLU utilizes completely positive
  matrices, and the inductive learner not only delivers superior accuracy but also
  offers an order of magnitude speedup over SDP with constant approximation guarantees.
