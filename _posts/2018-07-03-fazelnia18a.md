abstract: We present a new technique for solving non-convex variational inference
  optimization problems. Variational inference is a widely used method for posterior
  approximation in which the inference problem is transformed into an optimization
  problem. For most models, this optimization is highly non-convex and so hard to
  solve. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to solving the variational inference
  optimization based on convex relaxation and semidefinite programming. Our theoretical
  results guarantee very tight relaxation bounds that get nearer to the global optimal
  solution than traditional coordinate ascent. We evaluate the performance of our
  approach on regression and sparse coding.
