abstract: In this paper, we develop distributed optimization algorithms that are provably
  robust against Byzantine failuresâ€”arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior,
  in distributed computing systems, with a focus on achieving optimal statistical
  performance. A main result of this work is a sharp analysis of two robust distributed
  gradient descent algorithms based on median and trimmed mean operations, respectively.
  We prove statistical error rates for all of strongly convex, non-strongly convex,
  and smooth non-convex population loss functions. In particular, these algorithms
  are shown to achieve order-optimal statistical error rates for strongly convex losses.
  To achieve better communication efficiency, we further propose a median-based distributed
  algorithm that is provably robust, and uses only one communication round. For strongly
  convex quadratic loss, we show that this algorithm achieves the same optimal error
  rate as the robust distributed gradient descent algorithms.
