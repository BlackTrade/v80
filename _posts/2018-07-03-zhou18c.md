abstract: Recent years have witnessed exciting progress in the study of stochastic
  variance reduced gradient methods (e.g., SVRG, SAGA), their accelerated variants
  (e.g, Katyusha) and their extensions in many different settings (e.g., online, sparse,
  asynchronous, distributed). Among them, accelerated methods enjoy improved convergence
  rates but have complex coupling structures, which makes them hard to be extended
  to more settings (e.g., sparse and asynchronous) due to the existence of perturbation.
  In this paper, we introduce a simple stochastic variance reduced algorithm (MiG),
  which enjoys the best-known convergence rates for both strongly convex and non-strongly
  convex problems. Moreover, we also present its efficient sparse and asynchronous
  variants, and theoretically analyze its convergence rates in these settings. Finally,
  extensive experiments for various machine learning problems such as logistic regression
  are given to illustrate the practical improvement in both serial and asynchronous
  settings.
