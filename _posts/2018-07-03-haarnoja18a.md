abstract: 'We address the problem of learning hierarchical deep neural network policies
  for reinforcement learning. In contrast to methods that explicitly restrict or cripple
  lower layers of a hierarchy to force them to use higher-level modulating signals,
  each layer in our framework is trained to directly solve the task, but acquires
  a range of diverse strategies via a maximum entropy reinforcement learning objective.
  Each layer is also augmented with latent random variables, which are sampled from
  a prior distribution during the training of that layer. The maximum entropy objective
  causes these latent variables to be incorporated into the layerâ€™s policy, and the
  higher level layer can directly control the behavior of the lower layer through
  this latent space. Furthermore, by constraining the mapping from latent variables
  to actions to be invertible, higher layers retain full expressivity: neither the
  higher layers nor the lower layers are constrained in their behavior. Our experimental
  evaluation demonstrates that we can improve on the performance of single-layer policies
  on standard benchmark tasks simply by adding additional layers, and that our method
  can solve more complex sparse-reward tasks by learning higher-level policies on
  top of high-entropy skills optimized for simple low-level objectives.'
