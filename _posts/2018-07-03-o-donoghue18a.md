abstract: We consider the exploration/exploitation problem in reinforcement learning.
  For exploitation, it is well known that the Bellman equation connects the value
  at any time-step to the expected value at subsequent time-steps. In this paper we
  consider a similar uncertainty Bellman equation (UBE), which connects the uncertainty
  at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at subsequent time-steps, thereby
  extending the potential exploratory benefit of a policy beyond individual time-steps.
  We prove that the unique fixed point of the UBE yields an upper bound on the variance
  of the posterior distribution of the Q-values induced by any policy. This bound
  can be much tighter than traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard
  deviation rather than variance. Importantly, and unlike several existing approaches
  to optimism, this method scales naturally to large systems with complex generalization.
  Substituting our UBE-exploration strategy for $ε$-greedy improves DQN performance
  on 51 out of 57 games in the Atari suite.
