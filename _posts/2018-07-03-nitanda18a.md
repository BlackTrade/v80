abstract: 'Residual Networks (ResNets) have become state-of-the-art models in deep
  learning and several theoretical studies have been devoted to understanding why
  ResNet works so well.One attractive viewpoint on ResNet is that it is optimizing
  the risk in a functional space by consisting of an ensemble of effective features.
  In this paper, we adopt this viewpoint to construct a new gradient boosting method,
  which is known to be very powerful in data analysis.To do so, we formalize the boosting
  perspective of ResNet mathematically using the notion of functional gradients and
  propose a new method called ResFGB for classification tasks by leveraging ResNet
  perception.Two types of generalization guarantees are provided from the optimization
  perspective: one is the margin bound and the other is the expected risk bound by
  the sample-splitting technique.Experimental results show superior performance of
  the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods such as LightGBM.'
