abstract: A new generative adversarial network is developed for joint distribution
  matching.Distinct from most existing approaches, that only learn conditional distributions,
  the proposed model aims to learn a joint distribution of multiple random variables
  (domains). This is achieved by learning to sample from conditional distributions
  between the domains, while simultaneously learning to sample from the marginals
  of each individual domain.The proposed framework consists of multiple generators
  and a single softmax-based critic, all jointly trained via adversarial learning.From
  a simple noise source, the proposed framework allows synthesis of draws from the
  marginals, conditional draws given observations from a subset of random variables,
  or complete draws from the full joint distribution. Most examples considered are
  for joint analysis of two domains, with examples for three domains also presented.
