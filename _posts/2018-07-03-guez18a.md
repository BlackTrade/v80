abstract: Planning problems are among the most important and well-studied problems
  in artificial intelligence. They are most typically solved by tree search algorithms
  that simulate ahead into the future, evaluate future states, and back-up those evaluations
  to the root of a search tree. Among these algorithms, Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS)
  is one of the most general, powerful and widely used. A typical implementation of
  MCTS uses cleverly designed rules, optimised to the particular characteristics of
  the domain. These rules control where the simulation traverses, what to evaluate
  in the states that are reached, and how to back-up those evaluations. In this paper
  we instead learn where, what and how to search. Our architecture, which we call
  an MCTSnet, incorporates simulation-based search inside a neural network, by expanding,
  evaluating and backing-up a vector embedding. The parameters of the network are
  trained end-to-end using gradient-based optimisation. When applied to small searches
  in the well-known planning problem Sokoban, the learned search algorithm significantly
  outperformed MCTS baselines.
