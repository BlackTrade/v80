abstract: Probabilistic programming languages are a flexible tool for specifying statistical
  models, but this flexibility comes at the cost of efficient analysis. It is currently
  difficult to compactly represent the subtle independence properties of a probabilistic
  program, and exploit independence properties to decompose inference. Classical graphical
  model abstractions do capture some properties of the underlying distribution, enabling
  inference algorithms to operate at the level of the graph topology. However, we
  observe that graph-based abstractions are often too coarse to capture interesting
  properties of programs. We propose a form of sound abstraction for probabilistic
  programs wherein the abstractions are themselves simplified programs. We provide
  a theoretical foundation for these abstractions, as well as an algorithm to generate
  them. Experimentally, we also illustrate the practical benefits of our framework
  as a tool to decompose probabilistic program inference.
