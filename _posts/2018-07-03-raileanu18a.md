abstract: 'We consider the multi-agent reinforcement learningsetting with imperfect
  information. The rewardfunction depends on the hidden goals ofboth agents, so the
  agents must infer the otherplayers’ goals from their observed behavior inorder to
  maximize their returns. We propose anew approach for learning in these domains:
  SelfOther-Modeling (SOM), in which an agent usesits own policy to predict the other
  agent’s actionsand update its belief of their hidden goal in an onlinemanner. We
  evaluate this approach on threedifferent tasks and show that the agents are ableto
  learn better policies using their estimate of theother players’ goals, in both cooperative
  and competitivesettings.'
