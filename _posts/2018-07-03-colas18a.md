abstract: In continuous action domains, standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms
  like DDPG suffer from inefficient exploration when facing sparse or deceptive reward
  problems. Conversely, evolutionary and developmental methods focusingon exploration
  like Novelty Search, Quality-Diversity or Goal Exploration Processes explore more
  robustly but are less efficient at fine-tuning policies using gradient-descent.
  In this paper, we present the GEP-PG approach, taking the best of both worlds by
  sequentially combining a Goal Exploration Process and two variants of DDPG . We
  study the learning performance of these components and their combination on a low
  dimensional deceptive reward problem and on the larger Half-Cheetah benchmark. We
  show that DDPG fails on the former and that GEP-PG improves over the best DDPG variant
  in both environments.
