abstract: Two popular examples of first-order optimization methods over linear spaces
  are coordinate descent and matching pursuit algorithms, with their randomized variants.
  While the former targets the optimization by moving along coordinates, the latter
  considers a generalized notion of directions. Exploiting the connection between
  the two algorithms, we present a unified analysis of both, providing affine invariant
  sublinear $O(1/t)$ rates on smooth objectives and linear convergence on strongly
  convex objectives. As a byproduct of our affine invariant analysis of matching pursuit,
  our rates for steepest coordinate descent are the tightest known. Furthermore, we
  show the first accelerated convergence rate $O(1/t^2)$ for matching pursuit and
  steepest coordinate descent on convex objectives.
