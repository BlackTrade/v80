abstract: This paper studies the problemof estimating the graphon function – a generativemechanism
  for a class of random graphs that are usefulapproximations to real networks.Specifically,
  a graph of $n$ vertices is generated such that each pair of two vertices $i$ and
  $j$ are connected independently with probability$\rho_n \times f(x_i,x_j)$, where
  $x_i$ is the unknown $d$-dimensional label of vertex $i$, $f$ is an unknown symmetric
  function, and $\rho_n$,assumed to be $Ω(\log n/n)$,is a scaling parameter characterizing
  the graph sparsity. The taskis to estimate graphon $f$ given the graph. Recent studies
  have identified the minimax optimal estimation error rate for $d=1$. However, there
  exists a wide gap betweenthe known error rates of polynomial-time estimators and
  the minimax optimal error rate. We improve on the previously known error rates of
  polynomial-time estimators, by analyzing a spectral method, namely universal singular
  value thresholding (USVT) algorithm.When $f$ belongs to either Hölder or Sobolev
  space with smoothness index $α$, we show the error rates of USVT are at most $(nρ)^
  -2 α/ (2α+d)$.These error rates approach the minimax optimal error rate $\log (nρ)/(nρ)$
  proved in prior work for $d=1$, as $α$ increases, i.e., $f$ becomes smoother. Furthermore,
  when $f$ is analytic with infinitely many times differentiability, we show the error
  rate of USVT is at most $\log^d (nρ)/(nρ)$. When $f$ is a step function which corresponds
  to the stochastic block modelwith $k$ blocks for some $k$, the error rate of USVT
  is at most $k/(nρ)$, whichis larger than the minimax optimal error rate by at most
  a multiplicative factor $k/\log k$.This coincides with the computational gap observed
  in community detection. A key ingredient of our analysis is to derive the eigenvalue
  decaying rate of the edge probability matrix using piecewise polynomial approximations
  of the graphon function $f$.
