abstract: In conventional ODE modelling coefficients of an equation driving the system
  state forward in time are estimated. However, for many complex systems it is practically
  impossible to determine the equations or interactions governing the underlying dynamics.
  In these settings, parametric ODE model cannot be formulated. Here, we overcome
  this issue by introducing a novel paradigm of nonparametric ODE modelling that can
  learn the underlying dynamics of arbitrary continuous-time systems without prior
  knowledge. We propose to learn non-linear, unknown differential functions from state
  observations using Gaussian process vector fields within the exact ODE formalism.
  We demonstrate the model’s capabilities to infer dynamics from sparse data and to
  simulate the system forward into future.
