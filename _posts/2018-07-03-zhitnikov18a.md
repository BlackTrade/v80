abstract: In many areas of neuroscience and biological data analysis, it is desired
  to reveal common patterns among a group of subjects. Such analyses play important
  roles e.g., in detecting functional brain networks from fMRI scans and in identifying
  brain regions which show increased activity in response to certain stimuli. Group
  level techniques usually assume that all subjects in the group behave according
  to a single statistical model, or that deviations from the common model have simple
  parametric forms. Therefore, complex subject-specific deviations from the common
  model severely impair the performance of such methods. In this paper, we propose
  nonparametric algorithms for estimating the common covariance matrix and the common
  density function of several variables in a heterogeneous group of subjects. Our
  estimates converge to the true model as the number of subjects tends to infinity,
  under very mild conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods through
  extensive simulations as well as on real-data from fMRI scans and from arterial
  blood pressure and photoplethysmogram measurements.
