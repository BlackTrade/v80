abstract: It is one typical and general topic of learning a good embedding model to
  efficiently learn the representation coefficients between two spaces/subspaces.
  To solve this task, $L_{1}$ regularization is widely used for the pursuit of feature
  selection and avoiding overfitting, and yet the sparse estimation of features in
  $L_{1}$ regularization may cause the underfitting of training data. $L_{2}$ regularization
  is also frequently used, but it is a biased estimator. In this paper, we propose
  the idea that the features consist of three orthogonal parts, <em>namely</em> sparse
  strong signals, dense weak signals and random noise, in which both strong and weak
  signals contribute to the fitting of data. To facilitate such novel decomposition,
  <em>MSplit</em> LBI is for the first time proposed to realize feature selection
  and dense estimation simultaneously. We provide theoretical and simulational verification
  that our method exceeds $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ regularization, and extensive experimental
  results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the few-shot
  and zero-shot learning.
