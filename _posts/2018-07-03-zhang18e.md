abstract: Submodular functions are discrete analogs of convex functions, which have
  applications in various fields, including machine learning and computer vision.
  However, in large-scale applications, solving Submodular Function Minimization (SFM)
  problems remains challenging. In this paper, we make the first attempt to extend
  the emerging technique named screening in large-scale sparse learning to SFM for
  accelerating its optimization process. We first conduct a careful studying of the
  relationships between SFM and the corresponding convex proximal problems, as well
  as the accurate primal optimum estimation of the proximal problems. Relying on this
  study, we subsequently propose a novel safe screening method to quickly identify
  the elements guaranteed to be included (we refer to them as active) or excluded
  (inactive) in the final optimal solution of SFM during the optimization process.
  By removing the inactive elements and fixing the active ones, the problem size can
  be dramatically reduced, leading to great savings in the computational cost without
  sacrificing any accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the
  first screening method in the fields of SFM and even combinatorial optimization,
  thus pointing out a new direction for accelerating SFM algorithms. Experiment results
  on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the significant speedups gained
  by our approach.
