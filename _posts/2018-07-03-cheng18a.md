abstract: We consider the setting where we wish to perform ranking for hundreds of
  thousands of users which is common in recommender systems and web search ranking.
  Learning a single ranking function is unlikely to capture the variability across
  all users while learning a ranking function for each person is time-consuming and
  requires large amounts of data from each user. To address this situation, we propose
  a Factorization RankSVM algorithm which learns a series of k basic ranking functions
  and then constructs for each user a local ranking function that is a combination
  of them. We develop a fast algorithm to reduce the time complexity of gradient descent
  solver by exploiting the low-rank structure, and the resulting algorithm is much
  faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we prove that the generalization error
  of the proposed method can be significantly better than training individual RankSVMs.
  Finally, we present some interesting patterns in the principal ranking functions
  learned by our algorithms.
