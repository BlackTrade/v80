abstract: 'Direct policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning and continuous
  control problems are a popular approach for a variety of reasons: 1) they are easy
  to implement without explicit knowledge of the underlying model, 2) they are an
  “end-to-end” approach, directly optimizing the performance metric of interest, 3)
  they inherently allow for richly parameterized policies. A notable drawback is that
  even in the most basic continuous control problem (that of linear quadratic regulators),
  these methods must solve a non-convex optimization problem, where little is understood
  about their efficiency from both computational and statistical perspectives. In
  contrast, system identification and model based planning in optimal control theory
  have a much more solid theoretical footing, where much is known with regards to
  their computational and statistical properties. This work bridges this gap showing
  that (model free) policy gradient methods globally converge to the optimal solution
  and are efficient (polynomially so in relevant problem dependent quantities) with
  regards to their sample and computational complexities.'
