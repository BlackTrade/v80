abstract: Understanding and interacting with everyday physical scenes requires rich
  knowledge about the structure of the world, represented either implicitly in a value
  or policy function, or explicitly in a transition model. Here we introduce a new
  class of learnable models–based on graph networks–which implement an inductive bias
  for object- and relation-centric representations of complex, dynamical systems.
  Our results show that as a forward model, our approach supports accurate predictions
  from real and simulated data, and surprisingly strong and efficient generalization,
  across eight distinct physical systems which we varied parametrically and structurally.
  We also found that our inference model can perform system identification. Our models
  are also differentiable, and support online planning via gradient-based trajectory
  optimization, as well as offline policy optimization. Our framework offers new opportunities
  for harnessing and exploiting rich knowledge about the world, and takes a key step
  toward building machines with more human-like representations of the world.
