abstract: Submodular functions have become a ubiquitous tool in machine learning.
  They are learnable from data, and can be optimized efficiently and with guarantees.
  Nonetheless, recent negative results show that optimizing learned surrogates of
  submodular functions can result in arbitrarily bad approximations of the true optimum.
  Our goal in this paper is to highlight the source of this hardness, and propose
  an alternative criterion for optimizing general combinatorial functions from sampled
  data. We prove a tight equivalence showing that a class of functions is optimizable
  if and only if it can be learned. We provide efficient and scalable optimization
  algorithms for several function classes of interest, and demonstrate their utility
  on the task of optimally choosing trending social media items.
