abstract: For problems with large output spaces, evaluation of the loss function and
  its gradient are expensive, typically taking linear time in the size of the output
  space. Recently, methods have been developed to speed up learning via efficient
  data structures for Nearest-Neighbor Search (NNS) or Maximum Inner-Product Search
  (MIPS). However, the performance of such data structures typically degrades in high
  dimensions. In this work, we propose a novel technique to reduce the intractable
  high dimensional search problem to several much more tractable lower dimensional
  ones via dual decomposition of the loss function. At the same time, we demonstrate
  guaranteed convergence to the original loss via a greedy message passing procedure.
  In our experiments on multiclass and multilabel classification with hundreds of
  thousands of classes, as well as training skip-gram word embeddings with a vocabulary
  size of half a million, our technique consistently improves the accuracy of search-based
  gradient approximation methods and outperforms sampling-based gradient approximation
  methods by a large margin.
