abstract: 'Boolean tensor decomposition approximates data of multi-way binary relationships
  as product of interpretable low-rank binary factors, following the rules Boolean
  algebra. Here, we present its first probabilistic treatment. We facilitate scalable
  sampling-based posterior inference by exploitation of the combinatorial structure
  of the factor conditionals. Maximum a posteriori estimates consistently outperform
  existing non-probabilistic approaches. We show that our performance gains can partially
  be explained by convergence to solutions that occupy relatively large regions of
  the parameter space, as well as by implicit model averaging. Moreover, the Bayesian
  treatment facilitates model selection with much greater accuracy than the previously
  suggested minimum description length based approach. We investigate three real-world
  data sets. First, temporal interaction networks and behavioural data of university
  students demonstrate the inference of instructive latent patterns. Next, we decompose
  a tensor with more than 10 Billion data points, indicating relations of gene expression
  in cancer patients. Not only does this demonstrate scalability, it also provides
  an entirely novel perspective on relational properties of continuous data and, in
  the present example, on the molecular heterogeneity of cancer. Our implementation
  is available on GitHub: https://github.com/TammoR/LogicalFactorisationMachines'
