abstract: The problem of splitting attributes is one of the main steps in the construction
  of decision trees.In order to decide the best split, impurity measures such as Entropy
  and Gini are widely used. In practice, decision-tree inducers use heuristics for
  finding splits with small impurity when they consider nominal attributes with a
  large number of distinct values. However, there are no known guarantees for the
  quality of the splits obtained by these heuristics.To fill this gap, we propose
  two new splitting procedures that provably achieve near-optimal impurity. We also
  report experiments that provide evidence that the proposed methods are interesting
  candidates to be employed in splitting nominal attributes with many values during
  decision tree/random forest induction.
