abstract: We formulate a novel regularized risk minimization problem for learning
  in reproducing kernel Kre{ı̆}n spaces and show that the strong representer theorem
  applies to it. As a result of the latter, the learning problem can be expressed
  as the minimization of a quadratic form over a hypersphere of constant radius. We
  present an algorithm that can find a globally optimal solution to this non-convex
  optimization problem in time cubic in the number of instances. Moreover, we derive
  the gradient of the solution with respect to its hyperparameters and, in this way,
  provide means for efficient hyperparameter tuning. The approach comes with a generalization
  bound expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexity of the corresponding hypothesis
  space. The major advantage over standard kernel methods is the ability to learn
  with various domain specific similarity measures for which positive definiteness
  does not hold or is difficult to establish. The approach is evaluated empirically
  using indefinite kernels defined on structured as well as vectorial data. The empirical
  results demonstrate a superior performance of our approach over the state-of-the-art
  baselines.
