abstract: We present a new approach and a novel architecture, termed WSNet, for learning
  compact and efficient deep neural networks. Existing approaches conventionally learn
  full model parameters independently and then compress them via ad hoc processing
  such as model pruning or filter factorization. Alternatively, WSNet proposes learning
  model parameters by sampling from a compact set of learnable parameters, which naturally
  enforces parameter sharing throughout the learning process. We demonstrate that
  such a novel weight sampling approach (and induced WSNet) promotes both weights
  and computation sharing favorably. By employing this method, we can more efficiently
  learn much smaller networks with competitive performance compared to baseline networks
  with equal numbers of convolution filters. Specifically, we consider learning compact
  and efficient 1D convolutional neural networks for audio classification. Extensive
  experiments on multiple audio classification datasets verify the effectiveness of
  WSNet. Combined with weight quantization, the resulted models are up to 180x smaller
  and theoretically up to 16x faster than the well-established baselines, without
  noticeable performance drop.
