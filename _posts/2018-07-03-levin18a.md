abstract: Many popular dimensionality reduction procedures have out-of-sample extensions,
  which allow a practitioner to apply a learned embedding to observations not seen
  in the initial training sample. In this work, we consider the problem of obtaining
  an out-of-sample extension for the adjacency spectral embedding, a procedure for
  embedding the vertices of a graph into Euclidean space. We present two different
  approaches to this problem, one based on a least-squares objective and the other
  based on a maximum-likelihood formulation. We show that if the graph of interest
  is drawn according to a certain latent position model called a random dot product
  graph, then both of these out-of-sample extensions estimate the true latent position
  of the out-of-sample vertex with the same error rate. Further, we prove a central
  limit theorem for the least-squares-based extension, showing that the estimate is
  asymptotically normal about the truth in the large-graph limit.
