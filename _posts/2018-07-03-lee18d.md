abstract: We propose Deep Asymmetric Multitask Feature Learning (Deep-AMTFL) which
  can learn deep representations shared across multiple tasks while effectively preventing
  negative transfer that may happen in the feature sharing process. Specifically,
  we introduce an asymmetric autoencoder term that allows reliable predictors for
  the easy tasks to have high contribution to the feature learning while suppressing
  the influences of unreliable predictors for more difficult tasks. This allows the
  learning of less noisy representations, and enables unreliable predictors to exploit
  knowledge from the reliable predictors via the shared latent features. Such asymmetric
  knowledge transfer through shared features is also more scalable and efficient than
  inter-task asymmetric transfer.We validate our Deep-AMTFL model on multiple benchmark
  datasets for multitask learning and image classification, on which it significantly
  outperforms existing symmetric and asymmetric multitasklearning models, by effectively
  preventing negative transfer in deep feature learning.
