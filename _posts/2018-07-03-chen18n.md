abstract: We propose a nonconvex estimator for the covariate adjusted precision matrix
  estimation problem in the high dimensional regime, under sparsity constraints. To
  solve this estimator, we propose an alternating gradient descent algorithm with
  hard thresholding. Compared with existing methods along this line of research, which
  lack theoretical guarantees in optimization error and/or statistical error, the
  proposed algorithm not only is computationally much more efficient with a linear
  rate of convergence, but also attains the optimal statistical rate up to a logarithmic
  factor. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theory.
