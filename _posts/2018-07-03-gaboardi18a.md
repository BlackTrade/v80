abstract: The local model for differential privacy is emerging as the reference model
  for practical applications of collecting and sharing sensitive information while
  satisfyingstrong privacy guarantees. In the local model, there is no trusted entity
  which is allowed to have each individual’s raw data as is assumed in the traditional
  curator model. Individuals’ data are usually perturbed before sharing them. We explore
  the design of private hypothesis tests in the local model, where each data entry
  is perturbed to ensure the privacy of each participant. Specifically, we analyze
  locally private chi-square tests for goodness of fit and independence testing.
