abstract: Recent advances on the scalability and flexibility of variational inference
  have made it successful at unravelling hidden patterns in complex data. In this
  work we propose a new variational bound formulation, yielding an estimator that
  extends beyond the conventional variational bound. It naturally subsumes the importance-weighted
  and Renyi bounds as special cases, and it is provably sharper than these counterparts.
  We also present an improved estimator for variational learning, and advocate a novel
  high signal-to-variance ratio update rule for the variational parameters. We discuss
  model-selection issues associated with existing evidence-lower-bound-based variational
  inference procedures, and show how to leverage the flexibility of our new formulation
  to address them. Empirical evidence is provided to validate our claims.
