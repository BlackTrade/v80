abstract: We introduce SCAL, an algorithm designed to perform efficient exploration-exploration
  in any unknown weakly-communicating Markov Decision Process (MDP) for which an upper
  bound c on the span of the optimal bias function is known. For an MDP with $S$ states,
  $A$ actions and $\Gamma \leq S$ possible next states, we prove a regret bound of
  $O(c\sqrt{\Gamma SAT})$, which significantly improves over existing algorithms (e.g.,
  UCRL and PSRL), whose regret scales linearly with the MDP diameter $D$. In fact,
  the optimal bias span is finite and often much smaller than $D$ (e.g., $D=+\infty$
  in non-communicating MDPs). A similar result was originally derived by Bartlett
  and Tewari (2009) for REGAL.C, for which no tractable algorithm is available. In
  this paper, we relax the optimization problem at the core of REGAL.C, we carefully
  analyze its properties, and we provide the first computationally efficient algorithm
  to solve it. Finally, we report numerical simulations supporting our theoretical
  findings and showing how SCAL significantly outperforms UCRL in MDPs with large
  diameter and small span.
