abstract: The sheer scale of modern datasets has resulted in a dire need for summarization
  techniques that can identify representative elements in a dataset. Fortunately,
  the vast majority of data summarization tasks satisfy an intuitive diminishing returns
  condition known as submodularity, which allows us to find nearly-optimal solutions
  in linear time. We focus on a two-stage submodular framework where the goal is to
  use some given training functions to reduce the ground set so that optimizing new
  functions (drawn from the same distribution) over the reduced set provides almost
  as much value as optimizing them over the entire ground set. In this paper, we develop
  the first streaming and distributed solutions to this problem. In addition to providing
  strong theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate both the utility and efficiency of
  our algorithms on real-world tasks including image summarization and ride-share
  optimization.
