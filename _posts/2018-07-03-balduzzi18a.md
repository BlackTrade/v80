abstract: The cornerstone underpinning deep learning is the guarantee that gradient
  descent on an objective converges to local minima. Unfortunately, this guarantee
  fails in settings, such as generative adversarial nets, where there are multiple
  interacting losses. The behavior of gradient-based methods in games is not well
  understood – and is becoming increasingly important as adversarial and multi-objective
  architectures proliferate. In this paper, we develop new techniques to understand
  and control the dynamics in general games. The key result is to decompose the second-order
  dynamics into two components. The first is related to potential games, which reduce
  to gradient descent on an implicit function; the second relates to Hamiltonian games,
  a new class of games that obey a conservation law, akin to conservation laws in
  classical mechanical systems. The decomposition motivates Symplectic Gradient Adjustment
  (SGA), a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in general games. Basic experiments
  show SGA is competitive with recently proposed algorithms for finding local Nash
  equilibria in GANs – whilst at the same time being applicable to – and having guarantees
  in – much more general games.
