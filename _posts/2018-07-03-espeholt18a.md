abstract: In this work we aim to solve a large collection oftasks using a single reinforcement
  learning agentwith a single set of parameters. A key challengeis to handle the increased
  amount of data and extendedtraining time. We have developed a newdistributed agent
  IMPALA (Importance WeightedActor-Learner Architecture) that not only usesresources
  more efficiently in single-machine trainingbut also scales to thousands of machines
  withoutsacrificing data efficiency or resource utilisation.We achieve stable learning
  at high throughputby combining decoupled acting and learningwith a novel off-policy
  correction method calledV-trace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALAfor multi-task
  reinforcement learning onDMLab-30 (a set of 30 tasks from the DeepMindLab environment
  (Beattie et al., 2016)) and Atari57(all available Atari games in Arcade LearningEnvironment
  (Bellemare et al., 2013a)). Our resultsshow that IMPALA is able to achieve betterperformance
  than previous agents with less data,and crucially exhibits positive transfer betweentasks
  as a result of its multi-task approach.
