abstract: In this work we aim to solve a large collection of tasks using a single
  reinforcement learning agent with a single set of parameters. A key challenge is
  to handle the increased amount of data and extended training time. We have developed
  a new distributed agent IMPALA (Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture)
  that not only uses resources more efficiently in single-machine training but also
  scales to thousands of machines without sacrificing data efficiency or resource
  utilisation. We achieve stable learning at high throughput by combining decoupled
  acting and learning with a novel off-policy correction method called V-trace. We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALA for multi-task reinforcement learning on
  DMLab-30 (a set of 30 tasks from the DeepMind Lab environment (Beattie et al., 2016))
  and Atari57 (all available Atari games in Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare
  et al., 2013a)). Our results show that IMPALA is able to achieve better performance
  than previous agents with less data, and crucially exhibits positive transfer between
  tasks as a result of its multi-task approach.
