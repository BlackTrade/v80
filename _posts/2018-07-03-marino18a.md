abstract: Inference models are a key component in scaling variational inference to
  deep latent variable models, most notably as encoder networks in variational auto-encoders
  (VAEs). By replacing conventional optimization-based inference with a learned model,
  inference is amortized over data examples and therefore more computationally efficient.
  However, standard inference models are restricted to direct mappings from data to
  approximate posterior estimates. The failure of these models to reach fully optimized
  approximate posterior estimates results in an amortization gap. We aim toward closing
  this gap by proposing iterative inference models, which learn to perform inference
  optimization through repeatedly encoding gradients. Our approach generalizes standard
  inference models in VAEs and provides insight into several empirical findings, including
  top-down inference techniques. We demonstrate the inference optimization capabilities
  of iterative inference models and show that they outperform standard inference models
  on several benchmark data sets of images and text.
