abstract: Deep multitask learning boosts performance by sharing learned structure
  across related tasks. This paper adapts ideas from deep multitask learning to the
  setting where only a single task is available. The method is formalized as pseudo-task
  augmentation, in which models are trained with multiple decoders for each task.
  Pseudo-tasks simulate the effect of training towards closely-related tasks drawn
  from the same universe. In a suite of experiments, pseudo-task augmentation is shown
  to improve performance on single-task learning problems. When combined with multitask
  learning, further improvements are achieved, including state-of-the-art performance
  on the CelebA dataset, showing that pseudo-task augmentation and multitask learning
  have complementary value. All in all, pseudo-task augmentation is a broadly applicable
  and efficient way to boost performance in deep learning systems.
