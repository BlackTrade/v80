abstract: 'We study the problem of minimizing the sum of three convex functions: a
  differentiable, twice-differentiable and a non-smooth term in a high dimensional
  setting. To this effect we propose and analyze a randomized block cubic Newton (RBCN)
  method, which in each iteration builds a model of the objective function formed
  as the sum of the natural models of its three components: a linear model with a
  quadratic regularizer for the differentiable term, a quadratic model with a cubic
  regularizer for the twice differentiable term, and perfect (proximal) model for
  the nonsmooth term. Our method in each iteration minimizes the model over a random
  subset of blocks of the search variable. RBCN is the first algorithm with these
  properties, generalizing several existing methods, matching the best known bounds
  in all special cases. We establish $\cal O(1/ε)$, $\cal O(1/\sqrtε)$ and $\cal O(\log
  (1/ε))$ rates under different assumptions on the component functions. Lastly, we
  show numerically that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on a variety of
  machine learning problems, including cubically regularized least-squares, logistic
  regression with constraints, and Poisson regression.'
