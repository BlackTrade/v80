abstract: Datasets with significant proportions of noisy (incorrect) class labels
  present challenges for training accurate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose
  a new perspective for understanding DNN generalization for such datasets, by investigating
  the dimensionality of the deep representation subspace of training samples. We show
  that from a dimensionality perspective, DNNs exhibit quite distinctive learning
  styles when trained with clean labels versus when trained with a proportion of noisy
  labels. Based on this finding, we develop a new dimensionality-driven learning strategy,
  which monitors the dimensionality of subspaces during training and adapts the loss
  function accordingly. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is highly tolerant
  to significant proportions of noisy labels, and can effectively learn low-dimensional
  local subspaces that capture the data distribution.
