abstract: Off-policy learning is key to scaling up reinforcement learning as it allows
  to learn about a target policy from the experience generated by a different behavior
  policy. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to combine off-policy learning with
  function approximation and multi-step bootstrapping in a way that leads to both
  stable and efficient algorithms. In this work, we show that the Tree Backup and
  Retrace algorithms are unstable with linear function approximation, both in theory
  and in practice with specific examples. Based on our analysis, we then derive stable
  and efficient gradient-based algorithms using a quadratic convex-concave saddle-point
  formulation. By exploiting the problem structure proper to these algorithms, we
  are able to provide convergence guarantees and finite-sample bounds. The applicability
  of our new analysis also goes beyond Tree Backup and Retrace and allows us to provide
  new convergence rates for the GTD and GTD2 algorithms without having recourse to
  projections or Polyak averaging.
