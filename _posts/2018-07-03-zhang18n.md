abstract: We consider the fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
  problem, where the agents are connected via a time-varying and possibly sparse communication
  network. Specifically, we assume that the reward functions of the agents might correspond
  to different tasks, and are only known to the corresponding agent. Moreover, each
  agent makes individual decisions based on both the information observed locally
  and the messages received from its neighbors over the network. To maximize the globally
  averaged return over the network, we propose two fully decentralized actor-critic
  algorithms, which are applicable to large-scale MARL problems in an online fashion.
  Convergence guarantees are provided when the value functions are approximated within
  the class of linear functions. Our work appears to be the first theoretical study
  of fully decentralized MARL algorithms for networked agents that use function approximation.
