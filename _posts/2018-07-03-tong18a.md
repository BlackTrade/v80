abstract: Despite the considerable success enjoyed by machine learning techniques
  in practice, numerous studies demonstrated that many approaches are vulnerable to
  attacks. An important class of such attacks involves adversaries changing features
  at test time to cause incorrect predictions. Previous investigations of this problem
  pit a single learner against an adversary. However, in many situations an adversaryâ€™s
  decision is aimed at a collection of learners, rather than specifically targeted
  at each independently. We study the problem of adversarial linear regression with
  multiple learners. We approximate the resulting game by exhibiting an upper bound
  on learner loss functions, and show that the resulting game has a unique symmetric
  equilibrium. We present an algorithm for computing this equilibrium, and show through
  extensive experiments that equilibrium models are significantly more robust than
  conventional regularized linear regression.
