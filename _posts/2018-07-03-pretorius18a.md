abstract: Denoising autoencoders (DAEs) have proven useful for unsupervised representation
  learning, but a thorough theoretical understanding is still lacking of how the input
  noise influences learning. Here we develop theory for how noise influences learning
  in DAEs. By focusing on linear DAEs, we are able to derive analytic expressions
  that exactly describe their learning dynamics. We verify our theoretical predictions
  with simulations as well as experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10. The theory illustrates
  how, when tuned correctly, noise allows DAEs to ignore low variance directions in
  the inputs while learning to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in a comparison of the
  learning dynamics of DAEs to standard regularised autoencoders, we show that noise
  has a similar regularisation effect to weight decay, but with faster training dynamics.
  We also show that our theoretical predictions approximate learning dynamics on real-world
  data and qualitatively match observed dynamics in nonlinear DAEs.
