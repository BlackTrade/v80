abstract: 'While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated promising
  performance on multiple vision tasks, their learning dynamics are not yet well understood,
  both in theory and in practice.To address this issue, we study GAN dynamics in a
  simple yet rich parametric model that exhibits several of the common problematic
  convergence behaviors such as vanishing gradients, mode collapse, and diverging
  or oscillatory behavior.In spite of the non-convex nature of our model, we are able
  to perform a rigorous theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior.Our analysis
  reveals an interesting dichotomy: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges,
  while first order approximations of the discriminator steps lead to unstable GAN
  dynamics and mode collapse.Our result suggests that using first order discriminator
  steps (the de-facto standard in most existing GAN setups) might be one of the factors
  that makes GAN training challenging in practice.'
