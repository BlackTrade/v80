abstract: Double machine learning provides n^{1/2}-consistent estimates of parameters
  of interest even when high-dimensional or nonparametric nuisance parameters are
  estimated at an n^{-1/4} rate. The key is to employ Neyman-orthogonal moment equations
  which are first-order insensitive to perturbations in the nuisance parameters. We
  show that the n^{-1/4} requirement can be improved to n^{-1/(2k+2)} by employing
  a k-th order notion of orthogonality that grants robustness to more complex or higher-dimensional
  nuisance parameters. In the partially linear regression setting popular in causal
  inference, we show that we can construct second-order orthogonal moments if and
  only if the treatment residual is not normally distributed. Our proof relies on
  Steinâ€™s lemma and may be of independent interest. We conclude by demonstrating the
  robustness benefits of an explicit doubly-orthogonal estimation procedure for treatment
  effect.
