abstract: We identify obfuscated gradients, a kind of gradient masking, as a phenomenon
  that leads to a false sense of security in defenses against adversarial examples.
  While defenses that cause obfuscated gradients appear to defeat iterative optimization-based
  attacks, we find defenses relying on this effect can be circumvented. We describe
  characteristic behaviors of defenses exhibiting the effect, and for each of the
  three types of obfuscated gradients we discover, we develop attack techniques to
  overcome it. In a case study, examining non-certified white-box-secure defenses
  at ICLR 2018, we find obfuscated gradients are a common occurrence, with 7 of 9
  defenses relying on obfuscated gradients. Our new attacks successfully circumvent
  6 completely, and 1 partially, in the original threat model each paper considers.
