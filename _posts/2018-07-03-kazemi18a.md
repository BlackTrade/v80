abstract: Can we efficiently extract useful information from a large user-generated
  dataset while protecting the privacy of the users and/or ensuring fairness in representation?
  We cast this problem as an instance of a deletion-robust submodular maximization
  where part of the data may be deleted or masked due to privacy concerns or fairness
  criteria. We propose the first memory-efficient centralized, streaming, and distributed
  methods with constant-factor approximation guarantees against <em>any</em> number
  of adversarial deletions. We extensively evaluate the performance of our algorithms
  on real-world applications, including (i) Uber-pick up locations with location privacy
  constraints; (ii) feature selection with fairness constraints for income prediction
  and crime rate prediction; and (iii) robust to deletion summarization of census
  data, consisting of 2,458,285 feature vectors. Our experiments show that our solution
  is robust against even $80%$ of data deletion.
