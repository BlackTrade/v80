abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms involve the deep nesting of highly
  irregular computation patterns, each of which typically exhibits opportunities for
  distributed computation. We argue for distributing RL components in a composable
  way by adapting algorithms for top-down hierarchical control, thereby encapsulating
  parallelism and resource requirements within short-running compute tasks. We demonstrate
  the benefits of this principle through RLlib: a library that provides scalable software
  primitives for RL. These primitives enable a broad range of algorithms to be implemented
  with high performance, scalability, and substantial code reuse. RLlib is available
  as part of the open source Ray project at http://rllib.io/.'
