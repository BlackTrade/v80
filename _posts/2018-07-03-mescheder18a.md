abstract: 'Recent work has shown local convergence of GAN training for absolutely
  continuous data and generator distributions. In this paper, we show that the requirement
  of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample
  showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely
  continuous, unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we
  discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training.
  Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zero-centered gradient
  penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP
  with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always
  converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new
  explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we
  extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence
  for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie
  on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice
  and use them to learn high-resolution generative image models for a variety of datasets
  with little hyperparameter tuning.'
