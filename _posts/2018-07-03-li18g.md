abstract: This paper studies the estimation of low-rank Markov chains from empirical
  trajectories. We propose a non-convex estimator based on rank-constrained likelihood
  maximization. Statistical upper bounds are provided for the Kullback-Leiber divergence
  and the $\ell_2$ risk between the estimator and the true transition matrix. The
  estimator reveals a compressed state space of the Markov chain. We also develop
  a novel DC (difference of convex function) programming algorithm to tackle the rank-constrained
  non-smooth optimization problem. Convergence results are established. Experiments
  show that the proposed estimator achieves better empirical performance than other
  popular approaches.
