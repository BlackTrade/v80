abstract: A major challenge in contextual bandits is to design general-purpose algorithms
  that are both practically useful and theoretically well-founded. We present a new
  technique that has the empirical and computational advantages of realizability-based
  approaches combined with the flexibility of agnostic methods. Our algorithms leverage
  the availability of a regression oracle for the value-function class, a more realistic
  and reasonable oracle than the classification oracles over policies typically assumed
  by agnostic methods. Our approach generalizes both UCB and LinUCB to far more expressive
  possible model classes and achieves low regret under certain distributional assumptions.
  In an extensive empirical evaluation, we find that our approach typically matches
  or outperforms both realizability-based and agnostic baselines.
