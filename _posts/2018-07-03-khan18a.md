abstract: Uncertainty computation in deep learning is essential to design robust and
  reliable systems. Variational inference (VI) is a promising approach for such computation,
  but requires more effort to implement and execute compared to maximum-likelihood
  methods. In this paper, we propose new natural-gradient algorithms to reduce such
  efforts for Gaussian mean-field VI. Our algorithms can be implemented within the
  Adam optimizer by perturbing the network weights during gradient evaluations, and
  uncertainty estimates can be cheaply obtained by using the vector that adapts the
  learning rate. This requires lower memory, computation, and implementation effort
  than existing VI methods, while obtaining uncertainty estimates of comparable quality.
  Our empirical results confirm this and further suggest that the weight-perturbation
  in our algorithm could be useful for exploration in reinforcement learning and stochastic
  optimization.
