abstract: Convex sparsity-inducing regularizations are ubiquitous in high-dimensional
  machine learning, but solving the resulting optimization problems can be slow. To
  accelerate solvers, state-of-the-art approaches consist in reducing the size of
  the optimization problem at hand. In the context of regression, this can be achieved
  either by discarding irrelevant features (screening techniques) or by prioritizing
  features likely to be included in the support of the solution (working set techniques).
  Duality comes into play at several steps in these techniques. Here, we propose an
  extrapolation technique starting from a sequence of iterates in the dual that leads
  to the construction of improved dual points. This enables a tighter control of optimality
  as used in stopping criterion, as well as better screening performance of Gap Safe
  rules. Finally, we propose a working set strategy based on an aggressive use of
  Gap Safe screening rules. Thanks to our new dual point construction, we show significant
  computational speedups on multiple real-world problems.
