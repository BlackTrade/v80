abstract: Conventional embedding methods directly associate each symbol with a continuous
  embedding vector, which is equivalent to applying a linear transformation based
  on a “one-hot” encoding of the discrete symbols. Despite its simplicity, such approach
  yields the number of parameters that grows linearly with the vocabulary size and
  can lead to overfitting. In this work, we propose a much more compact K-way D-dimensional
  discrete encoding scheme to replace the “one-hot" encoding. In the proposed “KD
  encoding”, each symbol is represented by a $D$-dimensional code with a cardinality
  of $K$, and the final symbol embedding vector is generated by composing the code
  embedding vectors. To end-to-end learn semantically meaningful codes, we derive
  a relaxed discrete optimization approach based on stochastic gradient descent, which
  can be generally applied to any differentiable computational graph with an embedding
  layer. In our experiments with various applications from natural language processing
  to graph convolutional networks, the total size of the embedding layer can be reduced
  up to 98% while achieving similar or better performance.
