abstract: The multivariate probit model (MVP) is a popular classic model for studying
  binary responses of multiple entities. Nevertheless, the computational challenge
  of learning the MVP model, given that its likelihood involves integrating over a
  multidimensional constrained space of latent variables, significantly limits its
  application in practice. We propose a flexible deep generalization of the classic
  MVP, the Deep Multivariate Probit Model (DMVP), which is an end-to-end learning
  scheme that uses an efficient parallel sampling process of the multivariate probit
  model to exploit GPU-boosted deep neural networks. We present both theoretical and
  empirical analysis of the convergence behavior of DMVP’s sampling process with respect
  to the resolution of the correlation structure. We provide convergence guarantees
  for DMVP and our empirical analysis demonstrates the advantages of DMVP’s sampling
  compared with standard MCMC-based methods. We also show that when applied to multi-entity
  modelling problems, which are natural DMVP applications, DMVP trains faster than
  classical MVP, by at least an order of magnitude, captures rich correlations among
  entities, and further improves the joint likelihood of entities compared with several
  competitive models.
