abstract: We study the best arm identification problem in linear bandits, where the
  mean reward of each arm depends linearly on an unknown $d$-dimensional parameter
  vector $\theta$, and the goal is to identify the arm with the largest expected reward.
  We first design and analyze a novel randomized $\theta$ estimator based on the solution
  to the convex relaxation of an optimal $G$-allocation experiment design problem.
  Using this estimator, we describe an algorithm whose sample complexity depends linearly
  on the dimension $d$, as well as an algorithm with sample complexity dependent on
  the reward gaps of the best $d$ arms, matching the lower bound arising from the
  ordinary top-arm identification problem. We finally compare the empirical performance
  of our algorithms with other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample
  complexity and computational time.
