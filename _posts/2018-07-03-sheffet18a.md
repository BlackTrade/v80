abstract: We initiate the study of differentially private hypothesis testing in the
  local-model, under both the standard (symmetric) randomized-response mechanism (Warner
  1965, Kasiviswanathan et al, 2008) and the newer (non-symmetric) mechanisms (Bassily
  & Smith, 2015, Bassily et al, 2017). First, we study the general framework of mapping
  each userâ€™s type into a signal and show that the problem of finding the maximum-likelihood
  distribution over the signals is feasible. Then we discuss the randomized-response
  mechanism and show that, in essence, it maps the null- and alternative-hypotheses
  onto new sets, an affine translation of the original sets. We then give sample complexity
  bounds for identity and independence testing under randomized-response. We then
  move to the newer non-symmetric mechanisms and show that there too the problem of
  finding the maximum-likelihood distribution is feasible. Under the mechanism of
  Bassily et al we give identity and independence testers with better sample complexity
  than the testers in the symmetric case, and we also propose a $\chi^2$-based identity
  tester which we investigate empirically.
