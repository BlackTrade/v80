abstract: Ordinary differential equations, and in general a dynamical system viewpoint,
  have seen a resurgence of interest in developing fast optimization methods, mainly
  thanks to the availability of well-established analysis tools. In this study, we
  pursue a similar objective and propose a class of hybrid control systems that adopts
  a 2nd-order differential equation as its continuous flow. A distinctive feature
  of the proposed differential equation in comparison with the existing literature
  is a state-dependent, time-invariant damping term that acts as a feedback control
  input. Given a user-defined scalar $α$, it is shown that the proposed control input
  steers the state trajectories to the global optimizer of a desired objective function
  with a guaranteed rate of convergence $\mathcal{O}(e^{-αt})$. Our framework requires
  that the objective function satisfies the so called Polyak–{Ł}ojasiewicz inequality.
  Furthermore, a discretization method is introduced such that the resulting discrete
  dynamical system possesses an exponential rate of convergence.
