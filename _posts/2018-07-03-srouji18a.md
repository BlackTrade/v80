abstract: 'In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning has made impressive advances
  in solving several important benchmark problems for sequential decision making.
  Many control applications use a generic multilayer perceptron (MLP) for non-vision
  parts of the policy network. In this work, we propose a new neural network architecture
  for the policy network representation that is simple yet effective. The proposed
  Structured Control Net (SCN) splits the generic MLP into two separate sub-modules:
  a nonlinear control module and a linear control module. Intuitively, the nonlinear
  control is for forward-looking and global control, while the linear control stabilizes
  the local dynamics around the residual of global control. We hypothesize that this
  will bring together the benefits of both linear and nonlinear policies: improve
  training sample efficiency, final episodic reward, and generalization of learned
  policy, while requiring a smaller network and being generally applicable to different
  training methods. We validated our hypothesis with competitive results on simulations
  from OpenAI MuJoCo, Roboschool, Atari, and a custom urban driving environment, with
  various ablation and generalization tests, trained with multiple black-box and policy
  gradient training methods. The proposed architecture has the potential to improve
  upon broader control tasks by incorporating problem specific priors into the architecture.
  As a case study, we demonstrate much improved performance for locomotion tasks by
  emulating the biological central pattern generators (CPGs) as the nonlinear part
  of the architecture.'
