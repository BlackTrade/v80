abstract: Motivated by settings such as hyper-parameter tuning and physical simulations,
  we consider the problem of black-box optimization of a function. Multi-fidelity
  techniques have become popular for applications where exact function evaluations
  are expensive, but coarse (biased) approximations are available at much lower cost.
  A canonical example is that of hyper-parameter selection in a learning algorithm.
  The learning algorithm can be trained for fewer iterations â€“ this results in a lower
  cost, but its validation error is only coarsely indicative of the same if the algorithm
  had been trained till completion. We incorporate the multi-fidelity setup into the
  powerful framework of black-box optimization through hierarchical partitioning.
  We develop tree-search based multi-fidelity algorithms with theoretical guarantees
  on simple regret. We finally demonstrate the performance gains of our algorithms
  on both real and synthetic datasets.
