abstract: Most existing works on crowdsourcing assume that the workers follow the
  Dawid-Skene model, or the one-coin model as its special case, where every worker
  makes mistakes independently of other workers and with the same error probability
  for every task. We study a significant extension of this restricted model. We allow
  almost half of the workers to deviate from the one-coin model and for those workers,
  their probabilities of making an error to be task-dependent and to be arbitrarily
  correlated. In other words, we allow for arbitrary adversaries, for which not only
  error probabilities can be high, but which can also perfectly collude. In this adversarial
  scenario, we design an efficient algorithm to consistently estimate the workersâ€™
  error probabilities.
