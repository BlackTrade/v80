abstract: We consider the optimization problem associated with training simple ReLU
  neural networks of the form $\mathbf{x}\mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{k}\max\{0,\mathbf{w}_i^‚ä§\mathbf{x}\}$
  with respect to the squared loss. We provide a computer-assisted proof that even
  if the input distribution is standard Gaussian, even if the dimension is arbitrarily
  large, and even if the target values are generated by such a network, with orthonormal
  parameter vectors, the problem can still have spurious local minima once $6\le k\le
  20$. By a concentration of measure argument, this implies that in high input dimensions,
  <em>nearly all</em> target networks of the relevant sizes lead to spurious local
  minima. Moreover, we conduct experiments which show that the probability of hitting
  such local minima is quite high, and increasing with the network size. On the positive
  side, mild over-parameterization appears to drastically reduce such local minima,
  indicating that an over-parameterization assumption is necessary to get a positive
  result in this setting.
