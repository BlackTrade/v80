abstract: Meta-learning agents excel at rapidly learning new tasks from open-ended
  task distributions; yet, they forget what they learn about each task as soon as
  the next begins. When tasks reoccur – as they do in natural environments – meta-learning
  agents must explore again instead of immediately exploiting previously discovered
  solutions. We propose a formalism for generating open-ended yet repetitious environments,
  then develop a meta-learning architecture for solving these environments. This architecture
  melds the standard LSTM working memory with a differentiable neural episodic memory.
  We explore the capabilities of agents with this episodic LSTM in five meta-learning
  environments with reoccurring tasks, ranging from bandits to navigation and stochastic
  sequential decision problems.
