abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is introduced to expand the commonly
  used analytic variational distribution family, by mixing the variational parameter
  with a flexible distribution. This mixing distribution can assume any density function,
  explicit or not, as long as independent random samples can be generated via reparameterization.
  Not only does SIVI expand the variational family to incorporate highly flexible
  variational distributions, including implicit ones that have no analytic density
  functions, but also sandwiches the evidence lower bound (ELBO) between a lower bound
  and an upper bound, and further derives an asymptotically exact surrogate ELBO that
  is amenable to optimization via stochastic gradient ascent. With a substantially
  expanded variational family and a novel optimization algorithm, SIVI is shown to
  closely match the accuracy of MCMC in inferring the posterior in a variety of Bayesian
  inference tasks.
