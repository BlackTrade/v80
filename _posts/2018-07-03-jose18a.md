abstract: 'Our work addresses two important issues with recurrent neural networks:
  (1) they are over-parametrized, and (2) the recurrent weight matrix is ill-conditioned.
  The former increases the sample complexity of learning and the training time. The
  latter causes the vanishing and exploding gradient problem.We present a flexible
  recurrent neural network model called Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU). KRU achieves
  parameter efficiency in RNNs through a Kronecker factored recurrent matrix. It overcomes
  the ill-conditioning of the recurrent matrix by enforcing soft unitary constraints
  on the factors. Thanks to the small dimensionality of the factors, maintaining these
  constraints is computationally efficient.Our experimental results on seven standard
  data-sets reveal that KRU can reduce the number of parameters by three orders of
  magnitude in the recurrent weight matrix compared to the existing recurrent models,
  without trading the statistical performance.These results in particular show that
  while there are advantages in having a high dimensional recurrent space, the capacity
  of the recurrent part of the model can be dramatically reduced.'
