abstract: In reinforcement learning, it is common to let an agent interact for a fixed
  amount of time with its environment before resetting it and repeating the process
  in a series of episodes. The task that the agent has to learn can either be to maximize
  its performance over (i) that fixed period, or (ii) an indefinite period where time
  limits are only used during training to diversify experience. In this paper, we
  provide a formal account for how time limits could effectively be handled in each
  of the two cases and explain why not doing so can cause state-aliasing and invalidation
  of experience replay, leading to suboptimal policies and training instability. In
  case (i), we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of
  the environment, and thus a notion of the remaining time should be included as part
  of the agentâ€™s input to avoid violation of the Markov property. In case (ii), the
  time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning.
  We argue that this insight should be incorporated by bootstrapping from the value
  of the state at the end of each partial episode. For both cases, we illustrate empirically
  the significance of our considerations in improving the performance and stability
  of existing reinforcement learning algorithms, showing state-of-the-art results
  on several control tasks.
