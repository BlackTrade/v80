abstract: In several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods (e.g. RMSProp,
  Adam, Adadelta), parameter updates are scaled by the inverse square roots of exponential
  moving averages of squared past gradients. Maintaining these per-parameter second-moment
  estimators requires memory equal to the number of parameters. For the case of neural
  network weight matrices, we propose maintaining only the per-row and per-column
  sums of these moving averages, and estimating the per-parameter second moments based
  on these sums. We demonstrate empirically that this method produces similar results
  to the baseline. Secondly, we show that adaptive methods can produce larger-than-desired
  updates when the decay rate of the second moment accumulator is too slow. We propose
  update clipping and a gradually increasing decay rate scheme as remedies. Combining
  these methods and dropping momentum, we achieve comparable results to the published
  Adam regime in training the Transformer model on the WMT 2014 English-German machine
  translation task, while using very little auxiliary storage in the optimizer. Finally,
  we propose scaling the parameter updates based on the scale of the parameters themselves.
