abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework, called Programmatically Interpretable
  Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), that is designed to generate interpretable and verifiable
  agent policies. Unlike the popular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm, which
  represents policies by neural networks, PIRL represents policies using a high-level,
  domain-specific programming language. Such programmatic policies have the benefits
  of being more easily interpreted than neural networks, and being amenable to verification
  by symbolic methods. We propose a new method, called Neurally Directed Program Search
  (NDPS), for solving the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem of finding a
  programmatic policy with maximal reward. NDPS works by first learning a neural policy
  network using DRL, and then performing a local search over programmatic policies
  that seeks to minimize a distance from this neural “oracle”. We evaluate NDPS on
  the task of learning to drive a simulated car in the TORCS car-racing environment.
  We demonstrate that NDPS is able to discover human-readable policies that pass some
  significant performance bars. We also show that PIRL policies can have smoother
  trajectories, and can be more easily transferred to environments not encountered
  during training, than corresponding policies discovered by DRL.
