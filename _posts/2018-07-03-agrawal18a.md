abstract: Learning a Bayesian network (BN) from data can be useful for decision-making
  or discovering causal relationships. However, traditional methods often fail in
  modern applications, which exhibit a larger number of observed variables than data
  points. The resulting uncertainty about the underlying network as well as the desire
  to incorporate prior information recommend a Bayesian approach to learning the BN,
  but the highly combinatorial structure of BNs poses a striking challenge for inference.
  The current state-of-the-art methods such as order MCMC are faster than previous
  methods but prevent the use of many natural structural priors and still have running
  time exponential in the maximum indegree of the true directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  of the BN. We here propose an alternative posterior approximation based on the observation
  that, if we incorporate empirical conditional independence tests, we can focus on
  a high-probability DAG associated with each order of the vertices. We show that
  our method allows the desired flexibility in prior specification, removes timing
  dependence on the maximum indegree, and yields provably good posterior approximations;
  in addition, we show that it achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and sampler
  mixing on several datasets.
