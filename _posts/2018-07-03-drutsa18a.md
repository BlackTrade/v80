abstract: We study revenue optimization learning algorithms for repeated posted-price
  auctions where a seller interacts with a single strategic buyer that holds a fixed
  private valuation for a good and seeks to maximize his cumulative discounted surplus.We
  propose a novel algorithm that never decreases offered prices and has a tight strategic
  regret bound of $\Theta(\log\log T)$.This result closes the open research question
  on the existence of a no-regret horizon-independent weakly consistent pricing. We
  also show that the property of non-decreasing prices is nearly necessary for a weakly
  consistent algorithm to be a no-regret one.
