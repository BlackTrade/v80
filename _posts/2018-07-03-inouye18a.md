abstract: We propose a unified framework for deep density models by formally defining
  density destructors. A density destructor is an invertible function that transforms
  a given density to the uniform density—essentially destroying any structure in the
  original density. This destructive transformation generalizes Gaussianization via
  ICA and more recent autoregressive models such as MAF and Real NVP. Informally,
  this transformation can be seen as a generalized whitening procedure or a multivariate
  generalization of the univariate CDF function. Unlike Gaussianization, our destructive
  transformation has the elegant property that the density function is equal to the
  absolute value of the Jacobian determinant. Thus, each layer of a deep density can
  be seen as a shallow density—uncovering a fundamental connection between shallow
  and deep densities. In addition, our framework provides a common interface for all
  previous methods enabling them to be systematically combined, evaluated and improved.
  Leveraging the connection to shallow densities, we also propose a novel tree destructor
  based on tree densities and an image-specific destructor based on pixel locality.
  We illustrate our framework on a 2D dataset, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Code is available
  on first author’s website.
