abstract: 'Inspired by many applications of bipartite matching in online advertising
  and machine learning, we study a simple and natural iterative proportional allocation
  algorithm: Maintain a priority score $\priority_a$ for each node $a∈\mathds{A}$
  on one side of the bipartition, initialized as $\priority_a=1$. Iteratively allocate
  the nodes $i∈\impressions$ on the other side to eligible nodes in $\mathds{A}$ in
  proportion of their priority scores. After each round, for each node $a∈\mathds{A}$,
  decrease or increase the score $\priority_a$ based on whether it is over- or under-
  allocated. Our first result is that this simple, distributed algorithm converges
  to a $(1-ε)$-approximate fractional $b$-matching solution in $O({\log n\over ε^2}
  )$ rounds. We also extend the proportional allocation algorithm and convergence
  results to the maximum weighted matching problem, and show that the algorithm can
  be naturally tuned to produce maximum matching with <em>high entropy</em>. High
  entropy, in turn, implies additional desirable properties of this matching, e.g.,
  it satisfies certain diversity and fairness (aka anonymity) properties that are
  desirable in a variety of applications in online advertising and machine learning.'
