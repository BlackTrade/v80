abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful deep neural networks for
  graph-structured data. However, GCN computes the representation of a node recursively
  from its neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the
  number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling
  neighbors do not have convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per
  node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate
  based algorithms with new theoretical guarantee to converge to a local optimum of
  GCN regardless of the neighbor sampling size.Empirical results show that our algorithms
  enjoy similar convergence rate and model quality with the exact algorithm using
  only two neighbors per node. The running time of our algorithms on a large Reddit
  dataset is only one seventh of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.
