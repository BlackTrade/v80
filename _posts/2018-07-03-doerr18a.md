abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a highly expressive model class for learning
  patterns in time series data and for system identification. Deterministic versions
  of SSMs (e.g., LSTMs) proved extremely successful in modeling complex time series
  data. Fully probabilistic SSMs, however, are often found hard to train, even for
  smaller problems. We propose a novel model formulation and a scalable training algorithm
  based on doubly stochastic variational inference and Gaussian processes. This combination
  allows efficient incorporation of latent state temporal correlations, which we found
  to be key to robust training. The effectiveness of the proposed PR-SSM is evaluated
  on a set of real-world benchmark datasets in comparison to state-of-the-art probabilistic
  model learning methods. Scalability and robustness are demonstrated on a high dimensional
  problem.
