abstract: Modeling agent behavior is central to understanding the emergence of complex
  phenomena in multiagent systems. Prior work in agent modeling has largely been task-specific
  and driven by hand-engineering domain-specific prior knowledge. We propose a general
  learning framework for modeling agent behavior in any multiagent system using only
  a handful of interaction data. Our framework casts agent modeling as a representation
  learning problem. Consequently, we construct a novel objective inspired by imitation
  learning and agent identification and design an algorithm for unsupervised learning
  of representations of agent policies. We demonstrate empirically the utility of
  the proposed framework in (i) a challenging high-dimensional competitive environment
  for continuous control and (ii) a cooperative environment for communication, on
  supervised predictive tasks, unsupervised clustering, and policy optimization using
  deep reinforcement learning.
