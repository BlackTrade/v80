abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning when the experimenter
  is limited to perform at most $k$ non-adaptive experiments of size $1$. We formulate
  the problem of finding the best intervention target set as an optimization problem,
  which aims to maximize the average number of edges whose directions are resolved.
  We prove that the corresponding objective function is submodular and a greedy algorithm
  suffices to achieve $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation of the optimal value. We further
  present an accelerated variant of the greedy algorithm, which can lead to orders
  of magnitude performance speedup. We validate our proposed approach on synthetic
  and real graphs. The results show that compared to the purely observational setting,
  our algorithm orients the majority of the edges through a considerably small number
  of interventions.
