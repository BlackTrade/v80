abstract: Motivated by Supervised Opinion Analysis, we propose a novel framework devoted
  to Structured Output Learning with Abstention (SOLA). The structure prediction model
  is able to abstain from predicting some labels in the structured output at a cost
  chosen by the user in a flexible way. For that purpose, we decompose the problem
  into the learning of a pair of predictors, one devoted to structured abstention
  and the other, to structured output prediction. To compare fully labeled training
  data with predictions potentially containing abstentions, we define a wide class
  of asymmetric abstention-aware losses. Learning is achieved by surrogate regression
  in an appropriate feature space while prediction with abstention is performed by
  solving a new pre-image problem. Thus, SOLA extends recent ideas about Structured
  Output Prediction via surrogate problems and calibration theory and enjoys statistical
  guarantees on the resulting excess risk. Instantiated on a hierarchical abstention-aware
  loss, SOLA is shown to be relevant for fine-grained opinion mining and gives state-of-the-art
  results on this task. Moreover, the abstention-aware representations can be used
  to competitively predict user-review ratings based on a sentence-level opinion predictor.
