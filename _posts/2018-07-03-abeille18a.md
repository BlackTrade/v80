abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective approach to trade off exploration
  and exploration in reinforcement learning. Despite its empirical success and recent
  advances, its theoretical analysis is often limited to the Bayesian setting, finite
  state-action spaces, or finite-horizon problems. In this paper, we study an instance
  of TS in the challenging setting of the infinite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control,
  which models problems with continuous state-action variables, linear dynamics, and
  quadratic cost. In particular, we analyze the regret in the frequentist sense (i.e.,
  for a fixed unknown environment) in one-dimensional systems. We derive the first
  $O(\sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret bound for this problem, thus significantly improving
  the $O(T^{2/3})$ bound of Abeille & Lazaric (2017) and matching the frequentist
  performance derived by Abbasi-Yadkori & Szepesv√°ri (2011) for an optimistic approach
  and the Bayesian result Ouyang et al. (2017) We obtain this result by developing
  a novel bound on the regret due to policy switches, which holds for LQ systems of
  any dimensionality and it allows updating the parameters and the policy at each
  step, thus overcoming previous limitations due to lazy updates. Finally, we report
  numerical simulations supporting the conjecture that our result extends to multi-dimensional
  systems.
