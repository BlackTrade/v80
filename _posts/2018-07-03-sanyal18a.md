abstract: Machine learning methods are widely used for a variety of prediction problems.
  Prediction as a service is a paradigm in which service providers with technological
  expertise and computational resources may perform predictions for clients. However,
  data privacy severely restricts the applicability of such services, unless measures
  to keep client data private (even from the service provider) are designed. Equally
  important is to minimize the nature of computation and amount of communication required
  between client and server. Fully homomorphic encryption offers a way out, whereby
  clients may encrypt their data, and on which the server may perform arithmetic computations.
  The one drawback of using fully homomorphic encryption is the amount of time required
  to evaluate large machine learning models on encrypted data. We combine several
  ideas from the machine learning literature, particularly work on quantization and
  sparsification of neural networks, together with algorithmic tools to speed-up and
  parallelize computation using encrypted data.
