abstract: 'Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent
  structures in sequence modeling. It aims to use gates to control information flow
  (e.g., whether to skip some information or not) in the recurrent computations, although
  its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves this goal.
  In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM training, which pushes the output values
  of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing so, we can better control the information
  flow: the gates are mostly open or closed, instead of in a middle state, which makes
  the results more interpretable. Empirical studies show that (1) Although it seems
  that we restrict the model capacity, there is no performance drop: we achieve better
  or comparable performances due to its better generalization ability; (2) The outputs
  of gates are not sensitive to their inputs: we can easily compress the LSTM unit
  in multiple ways, e.g., low-rank approximation and low-precision approximation.
  The compressed models are even better than the baseline models without compression.'
