abstract: Distributed model training is vulnerable to byzantine system failures and
  adversarial compute nodes, i.e., nodes that use malicious updates to corrupt the
  global model stored at a parameter server (PS). To guarantee some form of robustness,
  recent work suggests using variants of the geometric median as an aggregation rule,
  in place of gradient averaging. Unfortunately, median-based rules can incur a prohibitive
  computational overhead in large-scale settings, and their convergence guarantees
  often require strong assumptions. In this work, we present DRACO, a scalable framework
  for robust distributed training that uses ideas from coding theory. In DRACO, each
  compute node evaluates redundant gradients that are used by the parameter server
  to eliminate the effects of adversarial updates. DRACO comes with problem-independent
  robustness guarantees, and the model that it trains is identical to the one trained
  in the adversary-free setup. We provide extensive experiments on real datasets and
  distributed setups across a variety of large-scale models, where we show that DRACO
  is several times, to orders of magnitude faster than median-based approaches.
