abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a two-step method to compute the Wasserstein
  distance in Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs): 1) The convex part
  of our objective can be solved by linear programming; 2) The non-convex residual
  can be approximated by a deep neural network. We theoretically prove that the proposed
  formulation is equivalent to the discrete Monge-Kantorovich dual formulation. Furthermore,
  we give the approximation error bound of the Wasserstein distance and the error
  bound of generalizing the Wasserstein distance from discrete to continuous distributions.
  Our approach optimizes the exact Wasserstein distance, obviating the need for weight
  clipping previously used in WGANs. Results on synthetic data show that the our method
  computes the Wasserstein distance more accurately. Qualitative and quantitative
  results on MNIST, LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method is more
  efficient than state-of-the-art WGAN methods, and still produces images of comparable
  quality.'
