abstract: We consider the problem of discrete-time signal denoising, focusing on a
  specific family of non-linear convolution-type estimators. Each such estimator is
  associated with a time-invariant filter which is obtained adaptively, by solving
  a certain convex optimization problem. Adaptive convolution-type estimators were
  demonstrated to have favorable statistical properties, see (Juditsky & Nemirovski,
  2009; 2010; Harchaoui et al., 2015b; Ostrovsky et al., 2016). Our first contribution
  is an efficient implementation of these estimators via the known first-order proximal
  algorithms. Our second contribution is a computational complexity analysis of the
  proposed procedures, which takes into account their statistical nature and the related
  notion of statistical accuracy. The proposed procedures and their analysis are illustrated
  on a simulated data benchmark.
