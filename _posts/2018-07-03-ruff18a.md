abstract: Despite the great advances made by deep learning in many machine learning
  problems, there is a relative dearth of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection.
  Those approaches which do exist involve networks trained to perform a task other
  than anomaly detection, namely generative models or compression, which are in turn
  adapted for use in anomaly detection; they are not trained on an anomaly detection
  based objective. In this paper we introduce a new anomaly detection method—Deep
  Support Vector Data Description—, which is trained on an anomaly detection based
  objective. The adaptation to the deep regime necessitates that our neural network
  and training procedure satisfy certain properties, which we demonstrate theoretically.
  We show the effectiveness of our method on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image benchmark datasets
  as well as on the detection of adversarial examples of GTSRB stop signs.
