abstract: Sampling methods that choose a subset of the data proportional to its diversity
  in the feature space are popular for data summarization. However, recent studies
  have noted the occurrence of bias {–} e.g., under or over representation of a particular
  gender or ethnicity {–} in such data summarization methods. In this paper we initiate
  a study of the problem of outputting a diverse and fair summary of a given dataset.
  We work with a well-studied determinantal measure of diversity and corresponding
  distributions (DPPs) and present a framework that allows us to incorporate a general
  class of fairness constraints into such distributions. Designing efficient algorithms
  to sample from these constrained determinantal distributions, however, suffers from
  a complexity barrier; we present a fast sampler that is provably good when the input
  vectors satisfy a natural property. Our empirical results on both real-world and
  synthetic datasets show that the diversity of the samples produced by adding fairness
  constraints is not too far from the unconstrained case.
