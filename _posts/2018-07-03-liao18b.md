abstract: Understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks is one of the key
  issues for the improvement of optimization algorithms as well as for the theoretical
  comprehension of why deep neural nets work so well today. In this paper, we introduce
  a random matrix-based framework to analyze the learning dynamics of a single-layer
  linear network on a binary classification problem, for data of simultaneously large
  dimension and size, trained by gradient descent. Our results provide rich insights
  into common questions in neural nets, such as overfitting, early stopping and the
  initialization of training, thereby opening the door for future studies of more
  elaborate structures and models appearing in todayâ€™s neural networks.
