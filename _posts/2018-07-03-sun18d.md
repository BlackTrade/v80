abstract: A matrix network is a family of matrices, with their relations modeled as
  a weighted graph. We consider the task of completing a partially observed matrix
  network. The observation comes from a novel sampling scheme where a fraction of
  matrices might be completely unobserved. How can we recover the entire matrix network
  from incomplete observations? This mathematical problem arises in many applications
  including medical imaging and social networks. To recover the matrix network, we
  propose a structural assumption that the matrices are low-rank after the graph Fourier
  transform on the network. We formulate a convex optimization problem and prove an
  exact recovery guarantee for the optimization problem. Furthermore, we numerically
  characterize the exact recovery regime for varying rank and sampling rate and discover
  a new phase transition phenomenon. Then we give an iterative imputation algorithm
  to efficiently solve optimization problem and complete large scale matrix networks.
  We demonstrate the algorithm with a variety of applications such as MRI and Facebook
  user network.
