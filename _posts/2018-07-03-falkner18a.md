abstract: 'Modern deep learning methods are very sensitive to many hyperparameters,
  and, due to the long training times of state-of-the-art models, vanilla Bayesian
  hyperparameter optimization is typically computationally infeasible. On the other
  hand, bandit-based configuration evaluation approaches based on random search lack
  guidance and do not converge to the best configurations as quickly. Here, we propose
  to combine the benefits of both Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods,
  in order to achieve the best of both worlds: strong anytime performance and fast
  convergence to optimal configurations. We propose a new practical state-of-the-art
  hyperparameter optimization method, which consistently outperforms both Bayesian
  optimization and Hyperbandon a wide range of problem types, including high-dimensional
  toy functions, support vector machines, feed-forward neural networks, Bayesian neural
  networks, deep reinforcement learning, and convolutional neural networks. Our method
  is robust and versatile, while at the same time being conceptually simple and easy
  to implement.'
