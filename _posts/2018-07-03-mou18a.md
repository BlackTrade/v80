abstract: 'We study the problem of generalization guarantees for dropout training.
  A general framework is first proposed for learning procedures with random perturbation
  on model parameters. The generalization error is bounded by sum of two offset Rademacher
  complexities: the main term is Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class with
  minus offset induced by the perturbation variance, which characterizes data-dependent
  regularization by the random perturbation; the auxiliary term is offset Rademacher
  complexity for the variance class, controlling the degree to which this regularization
  effect can be weakened. For neural networks, we estimate upper and lower bounds
  for the variance induced by truthful dropout, a variant of dropout that we propose
  to ensure unbiased output and fit into our framework, and the variance bounds exhibits
  connection to adaptive regularization methods. By applying our framework to ReLU
  networks with one hidden layer, a generalization upper bound is derived with no
  assumptions on the parameter norms or data distribution, with $O(1/n)$ fast rate
  and adaptivity to geometry of data points being achieved at the same time.'
