abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) aim to generate realistic data from
  some prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian noises). However, such prior distribution
  is often independent of real data and thus may lose semantic information (e.g.,
  geometric structure or content in images) of data. In practice, the semantic information
  might be represented by some latent distribution learned from data, which, however,
  is hard to be used for sampling in GANs. In this paper, rather than sampling from
  the pre-defined prior distribution, we propose a Local Coordinate Coding (LCC) based
  sampling method to improve GANs. We derive a generalization bound for LCC based
  GANs and prove that a small dimensional input is sufficient to achieve good generalization.
  Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
