abstract: In this paper we analyze an adaptive sampling approach for submodular maximization.
  Adaptive sampling is a technique that has recently been shown to achieve a constant
  factor approximation guarantee for submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint
  with exponentially fewer adaptive rounds than any previously studied constant factor
  approximation algorithm for this problem. Adaptivity quantifies the number of sequential
  rounds that an algorithm makes when function evaluations can be executed in parallel
  and is the parallel running time of an algorithm, up to low order terms. Adaptive
  sampling achieves its exponential speedup at the expense of approximation. In theory,
  it is guaranteed to produce a solutionthat is a 1/3 approximation to the optimum.
  Nevertheless, experiments show that adaptive sampling techniques achieve far better
  values in practice.In this paper we provide theoretical justification for this phenomenon.
  In particular, we showthat under very mild conditions of curvature of a function,
  adaptive sampling techniques achieve an approximation arbitrarily close to 1/2 while
  maintaining their low adaptivity. Furthermore, we show that the approximation ratio
  approaches 1 in direct relationship to a homogeneity property of the submodular
  function. In addition, we conductexperiments on real data sets in which the curvature
  and homogeneity properties can be easilymanipulated and demonstrate the relationship
  between approximation and curvature, as well asthe effectiveness of adaptive sampling
  in practice.
