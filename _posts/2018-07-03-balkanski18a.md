abstract: In this paper we analyze an adaptive sampling approach for submodular maximization.
  Adaptive sampling is a technique that has recently been shown to achieve a constant
  factor approximation guarantee for submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint
  with exponentially fewer adaptive rounds than any previously studied constant factor
  approximation algorithm for this problem. Adaptivity quantifies the number of sequential
  rounds that an algorithm makes when function evaluations can be executed in parallel
  and is the parallel running time of an algorithm, up to low order terms. Adaptive
  sampling achieves its exponential speedup at the expense of approximation. In theory,
  it is guaranteed to produce a solution that is a 1/3 approximation to the optimum.
  Nevertheless, experiments show that adaptive sampling techniques achieve far better
  values in practice. In this paper we provide theoretical justification for this
  phenomenon. In particular, we show that under very mild conditions of curvature
  of a function, adaptive sampling techniques achieve an approximation arbitrarily
  close to 1/2 while maintaining their low adaptivity. Furthermore, we show that the
  approximation ratio approaches 1 in direct relationship to a homogeneity property
  of the submodular function. In addition, we conduct experiments on real data sets
  in which the curvature and homogeneity properties can be easily manipulated and
  demonstrate the relationship between approximation and curvature, as well as the
  effectiveness of adaptive sampling in practice.
