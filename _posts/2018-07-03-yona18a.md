abstract: 'The seminal work of Dwork <em>et al.</em> [ITCS 2012] introduced a metric-based
  notion of individual fairness: given a task-specific similarity metric, their notion
  required that every pair of similar individuals should be treated similarly. In
  the context of machine learning, however, individual fairness does not generalize
  from a training set to the underlying population. We show that this can lead to
  computational intractability even for simple fair-learning tasks. With this motivation
  in mind, we introduce and study a relaxed notion of <em>approximate metric-fairness</em>:
  for a random pair of individuals sampled from the population, with all but a small
  probability of error, if they are similar then they should be treated similarly.
  We formalize the goal of achieving approximate metric-fairness simultaneously with
  best-possible accuracy as Probably Approximately Correct and Fair (PACF) Learning.
  We show that approximate metric-fairness <em>does</em> generalize, and leverage
  these generalization guarantees to construct polynomial-time PACF learning algorithms
  for the classes of linear and logistic predictors.'
