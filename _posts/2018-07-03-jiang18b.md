abstract: We provide initial seedings to the Quick Shift clustering algorithm, which
  approximate the locally high-density regions of the data. Such seedings act as more
  stable and expressive cluster-cores than the singleton modes found by Quick Shift.
  We establish statistical consistency guarantees for this modification. We then show
  strong clustering performance on real datasets as well as promising applications
  to image segmentation.
