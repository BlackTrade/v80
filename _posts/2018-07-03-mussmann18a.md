abstract: 'While active learning offers potential cost savings, the actual data efficiency—the
  reduction in amount of labeled data needed to obtain the same error rate—observed
  in practice is mixed. This paper poses a basic question: when is active learning
  actually helpful? We provide an answer for logistic regression with the popular
  active learning algorithm, uncertainty sampling. Empirically, on 21 datasets from
  OpenML, we find a strong inverse correlation between data efficiency and the error
  rate of the final classifier. Theoretically, we show that for a variant of uncertainty
  sampling, the asymptotic data efficiency is within a constant factor of the inverse
  error rate of the limiting classifier.'
