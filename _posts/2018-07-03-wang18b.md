abstract: We present PredRNN++, a recurrent network for spatiotemporal predictive
  learning. In pursuit of a great modeling capability for short-term video dynamics,
  we make our network deeper in time by leveraging a new recurrent structure named
  Causal LSTM with cascaded dual memories. To alleviate the gradient propagation difficulties
  in deep predictive models, we propose a Gradient Highway Unit, which provides alternative
  quick routes for the gradient flows from outputs back to long-range previous inputs.
  The gradient highway units work seamlessly with the causal LSTMs, enabling our model
  to capture the short-term and the long-term video dependencies adaptively. Our model
  achieves state-of-the-art prediction results on both synthetic and real video datasets,
  showing its power in modeling entangled motions.
