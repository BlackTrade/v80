abstract: We revisit the inductive matrix completion problem that aims to recover
  a rank-$r$ matrix with ambient dimension $d$ given $n$ features as the side prior
  information. The goal is to make use of the known $n$ features to reduce sample
  and computational complexities. We present and analyze a new gradient-based non-convex
  optimization algorithm that converges to the true underlying matrix at a linear
  rate with sample complexity only linearly depending on $n$ and logarithmically depending
  on $d$. To the best of our knowledge, all previous algorithms either have a quadratic
  dependency on the number of features in sample complexity or a sub-linear computational
  convergence rate. In addition, we provide experiments on both synthetic and real
  world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
