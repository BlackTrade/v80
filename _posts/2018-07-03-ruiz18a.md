abstract: 'Categorical distributions are ubiquitous in machine learning, e.g., in
  classification, language models, and recommendation systems. However, when the number
  of possible outcomes is very large, using categorical distributions becomes computationally
  expensive, as the complexity scales linearly with the number of outcomes. To address
  this problem, we propose augment and reduce (A&R), a method to alleviate the computational
  complexity. A&R uses two ideas: latent variable augmentation and stochastic variational
  inference. It maximizes a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data. Unlike
  existing methods which are specific to softmax, A&R is more general and is amenable
  to other categorical models, such as multinomial probit. On several large-scale
  classification problems, we show that A&R provides a tighter bound on the marginal
  likelihood and has better predictive performance than existing approaches.'
