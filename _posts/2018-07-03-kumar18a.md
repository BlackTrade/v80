abstract: Modern neural networks have recently been found to be poorly calibrated,
  primarily in the direction of over-confidence. Methods like entropy penalty and
  temperature smoothing improve calibration by clamping confidence, but in doing so
  compromise the many legitimately confident predictions. We propose a more principled
  fix that minimizes an explicit calibration error during training. We present MMCE,
  a RKHS kernel based measure of calibration that is efficiently trainable alongside
  the negative likelihood loss without careful hyper-parameter tuning. Theoretically
  too, MMCE is a sound measure of calibration that is minimized at perfect calibration,
  and whose finite sample estimates are consistent and enjoy fast convergence rates.
  Extensive experiments on several network architectures demonstrate that MMCE is
  a fast, stable, and accurate method to minimize calibration error while maximally
  preserving the number of high confidence predictions.
