abstract: Convolutional sparse coding (CSC) has been popularly used for the learning
  of shift-invariant dictionaries in image and signal processing. However, existing
  methods have limited scalability. In this paper, instead of convolving with a dictionary
  shared by all samples, we propose the use of a sample-dependent dictionary in which
  each filter is a linear combination of a small set of base filters learned from
  data. This added flexibility allows a large number of sample-dependent patterns
  to be captured, which is especially useful in the handling of large or high-dimensional
  data sets. Computationally, the resultant model can be efficiently learned by online
  learning. Extensive experimental results on a number of data sets show that the
  proposed method outperforms existing CSC algorithms with significantly reduced time
  and space complexities.
