abstract: 'Accelerated algorithms have broad applications in large-scale optimization,
  due to their generality and fast convergence. However, their stability in the practical
  setting of noise-corrupted gradient oracles is not well-understood. This paper provides
  two main technical contributions: (i) a new accelerated method AGDP that generalizes
  Nesterovâ€™s AGD and improves on the recent method AXGD (Diakonikolas & Orecchia,
  2018), and (ii) a theoretical study of accelerated algorithms under noisy and inexact
  gradient oracles, which is supported by numerical experiments. This study leverages
  the simplicity of AGDP and its analysis to clarify the interaction between noise
  and acceleration and to suggest modifications to the algorithm that reduce the mean
  and variance of the error incurred due to the gradient noise.'
