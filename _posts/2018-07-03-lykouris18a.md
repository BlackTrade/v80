abstract: We develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned
  oracle to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon unconditional worst
  case lower bounds when the oracle has low error. Our approach treats the oracle
  as a complete black box, and is not dependent on its inner workings, or the exact
  distribution of its errors. We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem
  {—} creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size k. We demonstrate that naively
  following the oracle’s recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when
  the average error is quite low. Instead we show how to modify the Marker algorithm
  to take into account the oracle’s predictions, and prove that this combined approach
  achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the oracle’s error decreases,
  and (ii) is always capped by O(log k), which can be achieved without any oracle
  input. We complement our results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm on
  real world datasets, and show that it performs well empirically even using simple
  off the shelf predictions.
