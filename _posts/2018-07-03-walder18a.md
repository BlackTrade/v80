abstract: We present a neural sequence model designed specifically for symbolic music.
  The model is based on a learned edit distance mechanism which generalises a classic
  recursion from computer science, leading to a neural dynamic program. Repeated motifs
  are detected by learning the transformations between them. We represent the arising
  computational dependencies using a novel data structure, the edit tree; this perspective
  suggests natural approximations which afford the scaling up of our otherwise cubic
  time algorithm. We demonstrate our model on real and synthetic data; in all cases
  it out-performs a strong stacked long short-term memory benchmark.
