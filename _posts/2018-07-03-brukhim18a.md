abstract: Many machine learning problems require the prediction of multi-dimensional
  labels. Such structured prediction models can benefit from modeling dependencies
  between labels. Recently, several deep learning approaches to structured prediction
  have been proposed. Here we focus on capturing cardinality constraints in such models.
  Namely, constraining the number of non-zero labels that the model outputs. Such
  constraints have proven very useful in previous structured prediction methods, but
  it is a challenge to introduce them into a deep learning approach. Here we show
  how to do this via a novel deep architecture. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
  achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-label classification benchmarks.
