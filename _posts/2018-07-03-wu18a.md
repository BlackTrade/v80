abstract: 'An important question that arises in the study of high dimensional vector
  representations learned from data is: given a set D of vectors and a query q, estimate
  the number of points within a specified distance threshold of q. Our algorithm uses
  locality sensitive hashing to preprocess the data to accurately and efficiently
  estimate the answers to such questions via an unbiased estimator that uses importance
  sampling. A key innovation is the ability to maintain a small number of hash tables
  via preprocessing data structures and algorithms that sample from multiple buckets
  in each hash table. We give bounds on the space requirements and query complexity
  of our scheme, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by experiments
  on a standard word embedding dataset.'
