abstract: We lay theoretical foundations for new database release mechanisms that
  allow third-parties to construct consistent estimators of population statistics,
  while ensuring that the privacy of each individual contributing to the database
  is protected. The proposed framework rests on two main ideas. First, releasing (an
  estimate of) the kernel mean embedding of the data generating random variable instead
  of the database itself still allows third-parties to construct consistent estimators
  of a wide class of population statistics. Second, the algorithm can satisfy the
  definition of differential privacy by basing the released kernel mean embedding
  on entirely synthetic data points, while controlling accuracy through the metric
  available in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We describe two instantiations
  of the proposed framework, suitable under different scenarios, and prove theoretical
  results guaranteeing differential privacy of the resulting algorithms and the consistency
  of estimators constructed from their outputs.
