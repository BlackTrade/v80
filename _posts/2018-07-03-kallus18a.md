abstract: Recent work in fairness in machine learning has proposed adjusting for fairness
  by equalizing accuracy metrics across groups and has also studied how datasets affected
  by historical prejudices may lead to unfair decision policies. We connect these
  lines of work and study the residual unfairness that arises when a fairness-adjusted
  predictor is not actually fair on the target population due to systematic censoring
  of training data by existing biased policies. This scenario is particularly common
  in the same applications where fairness is a concern. We characterize theoretically
  the impact of such censoring on standard fairness metrics for binary classifiers
  and provide criteria for when residual unfairness may or may not appear. We prove
  that, under certain conditions, fairness-adjusted classifiers will in fact induce
  residual unfairness that perpetuates the same injustices, against the same groups,
  that biased the data to begin with, thus showing that even state-of-the-art fair
  machine learning can have a "bias in, bias out" property. When certain benchmark
  data is available, we show how sample reweighting can estimate and adjust fairness
  metrics while accounting for censoring. We use this to study the case of Stop, Question,
  and Frisk (SQF) and demonstrate that attempting to adjust for fairness perpetuates
  the same injustices that the policy is infamous for.
