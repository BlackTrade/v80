abstract: We introduce a framework based on bilevel programming that unifies gradient-based
  hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. We show that an approximate version
  of the bilevel problem can be solved by taking into explicit account the optimization
  dynamics for the inner objective. Depending on the specific setting, the outer variables
  take either the meaning of hyperparameters in a supervised learning problem or parameters
  of a meta-learner.We provide sufficient conditions under which solutions of the
  approximate problem converge to those of the exact problem. We instantiate our approach
  for meta-learning in the case of deep learning where representation layers are treated
  as hyperparameters shared across a set of training episodes. In experiments, we
  confirm our theoretical findings, present encouraging results for few-shot learning
  and contrast the bilevel approach against classical approaches for learning-to-learn.
