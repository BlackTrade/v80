abstract: On the way to the robust learner for real-world applications, there are
  still great challenges, including considering unknown environments with limited
  data. Learnware (Zhou; 2016) describes a novel perspective, and claims that learning
  models should have reusable and evolvable properties. We propose to Encode Meta
  InformaTion of features (EMIT), as the model specification for characterizing the
  changes, which grants the model evolvability to bridge heterogeneous feature spaces.
  Then, pre-trained models from related tasks can be Reused by our REctiFy via heterOgeneous
  pRedictor Mapping (REFORM) framework. In summary, the pre-trained model is adapted
  to a new environment with different features, through model refining on only a small
  amount of training data in the current task. Experimental results over both synthetic
  and real-world tasks with diverse feature configurations validate the effectiveness
  and practical utility of the proposed framework.
