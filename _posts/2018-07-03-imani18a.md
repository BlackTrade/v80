abstract: 'There is growing evidence that converting targets to soft targets in supervised
  learning can provide considerable gains in performance. Much of this work has considered
  classification, converting hard zero-one values to soft labelsâ€”such as by adding
  label noise, incorporating label ambiguity or using distillation. In parallel, there
  is some evidence from a regression setting in reinforcement learning that learning
  distributions can improve performance. In this work, we investigate the reasons
  for this improvement, in a regression setting. We introduce a novel distributional
  regression loss, and similarly find it significantly improves prediction accuracy.
  We investigate several common hypotheses, around reducing overfitting and improved
  representations. We instead find evidence for an alternative hypothesis: this loss
  is easier to optimize, with better behaved gradients, resulting in improved generalization.
  We provide theoretical support for this alternative hypothesis, by characterizing
  the norm of the gradients of this loss.'
