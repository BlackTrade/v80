abstract: Predicting structured outputs can be computationally onerous due to the
  combinatorially large output spaces. In this paper, we focus on reducing the prediction
  time of a trained black-box structured classifier without losing accuracy. To do
  so, we train a speedup classifier that learns to mimic a black-box classifier under
  the learning-to-search approach. As the structured classifier predicts more examples,
  the speedup classifier will operate as a learned heuristic to guide search to favorable
  regions of the output space. We present a mistake bound for the speedup classifier
  and identify inference situations where it can independently make correct judgments
  without input features. We evaluate our method on the task of entity and relation
  extraction and show that the speedup classifier outperforms even greedy search in
  terms of speed without loss of accuracy.
