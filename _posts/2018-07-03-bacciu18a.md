abstract: We introduce the Contextual Graph Markov Model, an approach combining ideas
  from generative models and neural networks for the processing of graph data. It
  founds on a constructive methodology to build a deep architecture comprising layers
  of probabilistic models that learn to encode the structured information in an incremental
  fashion. Context is diffused in an efficient and scalable way across the graph vertexes
  and edges. The resulting graph encoding is used in combination with discriminative
  models to address structure classification benchmarks.
