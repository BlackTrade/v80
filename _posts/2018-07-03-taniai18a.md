abstract: We present a novel convolutional neural network architecture for photometric
  stereo (Woodham, 1980), a problem of recovering 3D object surface normals from multiple
  images observed under varying illuminations. Despite its long history in computer
  vision, the problem still shows fundamental challenges for surfaces with unknown
  general reflectance properties (BRDFs). Leveraging deep neural networks to learn
  complicated reflectance models is promising, but studies in this direction are very
  limited due to difficulties in acquiring accurate ground truth for training and
  also in designing networks invariant to permutation of input images. In order to
  address these challenges, we propose a physics based unsupervised learning framework
  where surface normals and BRDFs are predicted by the network and fed into the rendering
  equation to synthesize observed images. The network weights are optimized during
  testing by minimizing reconstruction loss between observed and synthesized images.
  Thus, our learning process does not require ground truth normals or even pre-training
  on external images. Our method is shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance
  on a challenging real-world scene benchmark.
