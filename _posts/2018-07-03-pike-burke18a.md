abstract: We study a variant of the stochastic $K$-armed bandit problem, which we
  call "bandits with delayed, aggregated anonymous feedback‚Äù. In this problem, when
  the player pulls an arm, a reward is generated, however it is not immediately observed.
  Instead, at the end of each round the player observes only the sum of a number of
  previously generated rewards which happen to arrive in the given round. The rewards
  are stochastically delayed and due to the aggregated nature of the observations,
  the information of which arm led to a particular reward is lost. The question is
  what is the cost of the information loss due to this delayed, aggregated anonymous
  feedback? Previous works have studied bandits with stochastic, non-anonymous delays
  and found that the regret increases only by an additive factor relating to the expected
  delay. In this paper, we show that this additive regret increase can be maintained
  in the harder delayed, aggregated anonymous feedback setting when the expected delay
  (or a bound on it) is known. We provide an algorithm that matches the worst case
  regret of the non-anonymous problem exactly when the delays are bounded, and up
  to logarithmic factors or an additive variance term for unbounded delays.
