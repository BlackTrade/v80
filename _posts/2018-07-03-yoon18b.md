abstract: Training complex machine learning models for prediction often requires a
  large amount of data that is not always readily available. Leveraging these external
  datasets from related but different sources is therefore an important task if good
  predictive models are to be built for deployment in settings where data can be rare.
  In this paper we propose a novel approach to the problem in which we use multiple
  GAN architectures to learn to translate from one dataset to another, thereby allowing
  us to effectively enlarge the target dataset, and therefore learn better predictive
  models than if we simply used the target dataset. We show the utility of such an
  approach, demonstrating that our method improves the prediction performance on the
  target domain over using just the target dataset and also show that our framework
  outperforms several other benchmarks on a collection of real-world medical datasets.
