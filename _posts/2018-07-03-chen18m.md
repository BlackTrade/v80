abstract: Although the convergence rates of existing variants of ADAGRAD have a better
  dependence on the number of iterations under the strong convexity condition, their
  iteration complexities have a explicitly linear dependence on the dimensionality
  of the problem. To alleviate this bad dependence, we propose a simple yet novel
  variant of ADAGRAD for stochastic (weakly) strongly convex optimization. Different
  from existing variants, the proposed variant (referred to as SADAGRAD) uses an adaptive
  restarting scheme in which (i) ADAGRAD serves as a sub-routine and is restarted
  periodically; (ii) the number of iterations for restarting ADAGRAD depends on the
  history of learning that incorporates knowledge of the geometry of the data. In
  addition to the adaptive proximal functions and adaptive number of iterations for
  restarting, we also develop a variant that is adaptive to the (implicit) strong
  convexity from the data, which together makes the proposed algorithm strongly adaptive.
  In terms of iteration complexity, in the worst case SADAGRAD has an O(1/ε) for finding
  an ε-optimal solution similar to other variants. However, it could enjoy faster
  convergence and much better dependence on the problem’s dimensionality when stochastic
  gradients are sparse. Extensive experiments on large-scale data sets demonstrate
  the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in comparison with several variants of
  ADAGRAD and stochastic gradient method.
