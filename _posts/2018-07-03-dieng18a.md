abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful models of sequential data.
  They have been successfully used in domains such as text and speech. However, RNNs
  are susceptible to overfitting; regularization is important. In this paper we develop
  Noisin, a new method for regularizing RNNs. Noisin injects random noise into the
  hidden states of the RNN and then maximizes the corresponding marginal likelihood
  of the data. We show how Noisin applies to any RNN and we study many different types
  of noise. Noisin is unbiasedâ€“it preserves the underlying RNN on average. We characterize
  how Noisin regularizes its RNN both theoretically and empirically. On language modeling
  benchmarks, Noisin improves over dropout by as much as 12.2% on the Penn Treebank
  and 9.4% on the Wikitext-2 dataset. We also compared the state-of-the-art language
  model of Yang et al. 2017, both with and without Noisin. On the Penn Treebank, the
  method with Noisin more quickly reaches state-of-the-art performance.
