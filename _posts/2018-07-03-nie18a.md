abstract: 'Backpropagation-based visualizations have been proposed to interpret convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs), however a theory is missing to justify their behaviors:
  Guided backpropagation (GBP) and deconvolutional network (DeconvNet) generate more
  human-interpretable but less class-sensitive visualizations than saliency map. Motivated
  by this, we develop a theoretical explanation revealing that GBP and DeconvNet are
  essentially doing (partial) image recovery which is unrelated to the network decisions.
  Specifically, our analysis shows that the backward ReLU introduced by GBP and DeconvNet,
  and the local connections in CNNs are the two main causes of compelling visualizations.
  Extensive experiments are provided that support the theoretical analysis.'
