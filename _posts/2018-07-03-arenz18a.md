abstract: Inference from complex distributions is a common problem in machine learning
  needed for many Bayesian methods. We propose an efficient, gradient-free method
  for learning general GMM approximations of multimodal distributions based on recent
  insights from stochastic search methods. Our method establishes information-geometric
  trust regions to ensure efficient exploration of the sampling space and stability
  of the GMM updates, allowing for efficient estimation of multi-variate Gaussian
  variational distributions. For GMMs, we apply a variational lower bound to decompose
  the learning objective into sub-problems given by learning the individual mixture
  components and the coefficients. The number of mixture components is adapted online
  in order to allow for arbitrary exact approximations. We demonstrate on several
  domains that we can learn significantly better approximations than competing variational
  inference methods and that the quality of samples drawn from our approximations
  is on par with samples created by state-of-the-art MCMC samplers that require significantly
  more computational resources.
