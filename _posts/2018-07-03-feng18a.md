abstract: In predictive modeling applications, it is often of interest to determine
  the relative contribution of subsets of features in explaining the variability of
  an outcome. It is useful to consider this variable importance as a function of the
  unknown, underlying data-generating mechanism rather than the specific predictive
  algorithm used to fit the data. In this paper, we connect these ideas in nonparametric
  variable importance to machine learning, and provide a method for efficient estimation
  of variable importance when building a predictive model using a neural network.
  We show how a single augmented neural network with multi-task learning simultaneously
  estimates the importance of many feature subsets, improving on previous procedures
  for estimating importance. We demonstrate on simulated data that our method is both
  accurate and computationally efficient, and apply our method to both a study of
  heart disease and for predicting mortality in ICU patients.
