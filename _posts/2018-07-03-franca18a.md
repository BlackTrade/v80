abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using tools from dynamicalsystems
  to analyze the behavior of simple optimization algorithms such asgradient descent
  and accelerated variants. This paper strengthens suchconnections by deriving the
  differential equations that model the continuouslimit of the sequence of iterates
  generated by the alternating direction methodof multipliers, as well as an accelerated
  variant. We employ the direct methodof Lyapunov to analyze the stability of critical
  points of the dynamicalsystems and to obtain associated convergence rates.
