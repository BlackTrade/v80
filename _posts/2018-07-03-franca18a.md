abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using tools from dynamical
  systems to analyze the behavior of simple optimization algorithms such as gradient
  descent and accelerated variants. This paper strengthens such connections by deriving
  the differential equations that model the continuous limit of the sequence of iterates
  generated by the alternating direction method of multipliers, as well as an accelerated
  variant. We employ the direct method of Lyapunov to analyze the stability of critical
  points of the dynamical systems and to obtain associated convergence rates.
