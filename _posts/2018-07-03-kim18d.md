abstract: The interpretation of deep learning models is a challenge due to their size,
  complexity, and often opaque internal state. In addition, many systems, such as
  image classifiers, operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which
  provide an interpretation of a neural net’s internal state in terms of human-friendly
  concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural
  net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique,
  Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree
  to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result–for example,
  how sensitive a prediction of “zebra” is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain
  of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to
  explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network
  as well as a medical application.
