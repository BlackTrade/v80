abstract: In many applications of deep learning, it is crucial to capture model and
  prediction uncertainty. Unlike classic neural networks (NN), Bayesian neural networks
  (BNN) allow us to reason about uncertainty in a more principled way. Stochastic
  Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) enables learning a BNN with only simple modifications
  to the standard optimization framework (SGD). Instead of obtaining a single point-estimate
  of the model, the result of SGLD is samples from the BNN posterior. However, SGLD
  and its extensions require storage of the entire history of model parameters, a
  potentially prohibitive cost (especially for large neural networks).We propose a
  framework, Adversarial Posterior Distillation, to distill the SGLD samples using
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). At test-time, samples are generated by the
  GAN. We show that this distillation framework incurs no loss in performance on recent
  BNN applications including anomaly detection, active learning, and defense against
  attacks. By construction, our framework not only distills the Bayesian predictive
  distribution, but the posterior itself. This allows users to compute quantity such
  as the approximate model variance, which is useful in the downstream tasks.
