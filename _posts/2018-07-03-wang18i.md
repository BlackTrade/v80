abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) allow us to reason about uncertainty in
  a principled way. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) enables efficient
  BNN learning by drawing samples from the BNN posterior using mini-batches. However,
  SGLD and its extensions require storage of many copies of the model parameters,
  a potentially prohibitive cost, especially for large neural networks. We propose
  a framework, Adversarial Posterior Distillation, to distill the SGLD samples using
  a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). At test-time, samples are generated by the
  GAN. We show that this distillation framework incurs no loss in performance on recent
  BNN applications including anomaly detection, active learning, and defense against
  adversarial attacks. By construction, our framework distills not only the Bayesian
  predictive distribution, but the posterior itself. This allows one to compute quantities
  such as the approximate model variance, which is useful in downstream tasks. To
  our knowledge, these are the first results applying MCMC-based BNNs to the aforementioned
  applications.
