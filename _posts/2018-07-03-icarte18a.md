abstract: In this paper we propose Reward Machines â€” a type of finite state machine
  that supports the specification of reward functions while exposing reward function
  structure to the learner and supporting decomposition. We then present Q-Learning
  for Reward Machines (QRM), an algorithm which appropriately decomposes the reward
  machine and uses off-policy q-learning to simultaneously learn subpolicies for the
  different components. QRM is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy in the
  tabular case, in contrast to Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning methods which might
  converge to suboptimal policies. We demonstrate this behavior experimentally in
  two discrete domains. We also show how function approximation methods like neural
  networks can be incorporated into QRM, and that doing so can find better policies
  more quickly than hierarchical methods in a domain with a continuous state space.
