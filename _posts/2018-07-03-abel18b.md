abstract: We consider the problem of how best to use prior experience to bootstrap
  lifelong learning, where an agent faces a series of task instances drawn from some
  task distribution. First, we identify the initial policy that optimizes expected
  performance over the distribution of tasks for increasingly complex classes of policy
  and task distributions. We empirically demonstrate the relative performance of each
  policy classâ€™ optimal element in a variety of simple task distributions. We then
  consider value-function initialization methods that preserve PAC guarantees while
  simultaneously minimizing the learning required in two learning algorithms, yielding
  MaxQInit, a practical new method for value-function-based transfer. We show that
  MaxQInit performs well in simple lifelong RL experiments.
