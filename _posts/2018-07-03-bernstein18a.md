abstract: 'Training large neural networks requires distributing learning across multiple
  workers, where the cost of communicating gradients can be a significant bottleneck.
  signSGD alleviates this problem by transmitting just the sign of each minibatch
  stochastic gradient. We prove that it can get the best of both worlds: compressed
  gradients and SGD-level convergence rate. The relative $\ell_1/\ell_2$ geometry
  of gradients, noise and curvature informs whether signSGD or SGD is theoretically
  better suited to a particular problem. On the practical side we find that the momentum
  counterpart of signSGD is able to match the accuracy and convergence speed of Adam
  on deep Imagenet models. We extend our theory to the distributed setting, where
  the parameter server uses majority vote to aggregate gradient signs from each worker
  enabling 1-bit compression of worker-server communication in both directions. Using
  a theorem by Gauss we prove that majority vote can achieve the same reduction in
  variance as full precision distributed SGD. Thus, there is great promise for sign-based
  optimisation schemes to achieve fast communication and fast convergence. Code to
  reproduce experiments is to be found at https://github.com/jxbz/signSGD.'
