abstract: We propose a novel distributed inference algorithm for continuous graphical
  models, by extending Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to leverage the Markov
  dependency structure of the distribution of interest. Our approach combines SVGD
  with a set of structured local kernel functions defined on the Markov blanket of
  each node, which alleviates the curse of high dimensionality and simultaneously
  yields a distributed algorithm for decentralized inference tasks. We justify our
  method with theoretical analysis and show that the use of local kernels can be viewed
  as a new type of localized approximation that matches the target distribution on
  the conditional distributions of each node over its Markov blanket. Our empirical
  results show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines including standard
  MCMC and particle message passing methods.
