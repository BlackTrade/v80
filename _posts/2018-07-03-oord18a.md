abstract: The recently-developed WaveNet architecture is the current state of the
  art in realistic speech synthesis, consistently rated as more natural sounding for
  many different languages than any previous system.However, because WaveNet relies
  on sequential generation of one audio sample at a time, it is poorly suited to todayâ€™s
  massively parallel computers, and therefore hard to deploy in a real-time production
  setting.This paper introduces Probability Density Distillation, a new methodfor
  training a parallel feed-forward network from a trained WaveNet with no significant
  difference in quality.The resulting system is capable of generating high-fidelity
  speech samples at more than 20 times faster than real-time, a 1000x speed up relative
  to the original WaveNet, and capable of serving multiple English and Japanese voices
  in a production setting.
