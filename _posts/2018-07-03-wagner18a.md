abstract: We consider the problem of labeling points on a fast-moving data stream
  when only a small number of labeled examples are available. In our setting, incoming
  points must be processed efficiently and the stream is too large to store in its
  entirety. We present a semi-supervised learning algorithm for this task. The algorithm
  maintains a small synopsis of the stream which can be quickly updated as new points
  arrive, and labels every incoming point by provably learning from the full history
  of the stream. Experiments on real datasets validate that the algorithm can quickly
  and accurately classify points on a stream with a small quantity of labeled examples.
