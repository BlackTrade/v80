abstract: Recent work has explored how to train machine learning models which do not
  discriminate against any subgroup of the population as determined by sensitive attributes
  such as gender or race. To avoid disparate treatment, sensitive attributes should
  not be considered. On the other hand, in order to avoid disparate impact, sensitive
  attributes must be examined, e.g., in order to learn a fair model, or to check if
  a given model is fair. We introduce methods from secure multi-party computation
  which allow us to avoid both. By encrypting sensitive attributes, we show how an
  outcome-based fair model may be learned, checked, or have its outputs verified and
  held to account, without users revealing their sensitive attributes.
