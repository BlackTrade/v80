abstract: State-action value functions (i.e., Q-values) are ubiquitous in reinforcement
  learning (RL), giving rise to popular algorithms such as SARSA and Q-learning. We
  propose a new notion of action value defined by a Gaussian smoothed version of the
  expected Q-value. We show that such smoothed Q-values still satisfy a Bellman equation,
  making them learnable from experience sampled from an environment. Moreover, the
  gradients of expected reward with respect to the mean and covariance of a parameterized
  Gaussian policy can be recovered from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value
  function. Based on these relationships we develop new algorithms for training a
  Gaussian policy directly from a learned smoothed Q-value approximator. The approach
  is additionally amenable to proximal optimization by augmenting the objective with
  a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. We find that the ability to learn
  both a mean and covariance during training leads to significantly improved results
  on standard continuous control benchmarks.
