abstract: 'We consider a generalization of the classic linear regression problem to
  the case when the loss is an Orlicz norm. An Orlicz norm is parameterized by a non-negative
  convex function G: R_+ - > R_+ with G(0) = 0: the Orlicz norm of a n-dimensional
  vector x is defined as |x|_G = inf alpha > 0 | sum_i = 1^n G( |x_i| / alpha ) <
  = 1 . We consider the cases where the function G grows subquadratically. Our main
  result is based on a new oblivious embedding which embeds the column space of a
  given nxd matrix A with Orlicz norm into a lower dimensional space with L2 norm.
  Specifically, we show how to efficiently find an mxn embedding matrix S (m < n),
  such that for every d-dimensional vector x, we have Omega(1/(d log n)) |Ax|_G <
  = |SAx|_2 < = O(d^2 log n) |Ax|_G. By applying this subspace embedding technique,
  we show an approximation algorithm for the regression problem min_x |Ax-b|_G, up
  to a O( d log^2 n ) factor. As a further application of our techniques, we show
  how to also use them to improve on the algorithm for the Lp low rank matrix approximation
  problem for 1 < = p < 2.'
