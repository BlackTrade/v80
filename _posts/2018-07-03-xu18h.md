abstract: This paper develops a novel methodology for using symbolic knowledge in
  deep learning. From first principles, we derive a semantic loss function that bridges
  between neural output vectors and logical constraints. This loss function captureshow
  close the neural network is to satisfying the constraints on its output. An experimental
  evaluation shows that it effectively guides the learner to achieve (near-)state-of-the-art
  results on semi-supervised multi-class classification. Moreover, it significantly
  increases the ability of the neural network to predict structured objects, such
  as rankings and paths. These discrete concepts are tremendously difficult to learn,
  and benefit from a tight integration of deep learning and symbolic reasoning methods.
