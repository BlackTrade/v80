abstract: In the online false discovery rate (FDR) problem, one observes a possibly
  infinite sequence of $p$-values $P_1,P_2,…$, each testing a different null hypothesis,
  and an algorithm must pick a sequence of rejection thresholds $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,…$
  in an online fashion, effectively rejecting the $k$-th null hypothesis whenever
  $P_k \leq \alpha_k$. Importantly, $\alpha_k$ must be a function of the past, and
  cannot depend on $P_k$ or any of the later unseen $p$-values, and must be chosen
  to guarantee that for any time $t$, the FDR up to time $t$ is less than some pre-determined
  quantity $\alpha \in (0,1)$. In this work, we present a powerful new framework for
  online FDR control that we refer to as “SAFFRON”. Like older alpha-investing algorithms,
  SAFFRON starts off with an error budget (called alpha-wealth) that it intelligently
  allocates to different tests over time, earning back some alpha-wealth whenever
  it makes a new discovery. However, unlike older methods, SAFFRON’s threshold sequence
  is based on a novel estimate of the alpha fraction that it allocates to true null
  hypotheses. In the offline setting, algorithms that employ an estimate of the proportion
  of true nulls are called “adaptive”, hence SAFFRON can be seen as an online analogue
  of the offline Storey-BH adaptive procedure. Just as Storey-BH is typically more
  powerful than the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure under independence, we demonstrate
  that SAFFRON is also more powerful than its non-adaptive counterparts such as LORD.
