abstract: In the online false discovery rate (FDR) problem, one observes apossibly
  infinite sequence of $p$-values $P_1,P_2,…$, each testinga different null hypothesis,
  and an algorithm must pick a sequence ofrejection thresholds $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,…$
  in an online fashion,effectively rejecting the $k$-th null hypothesis whenever $P_k
  ≤\alpha_k$. Importantly, $\alpha_k$ must be a function of the past, andcannot depend
  on $P_k$ or any of the later unseen $p$-values, and mustbe chosen to guarantee that
  for any time $t$, the FDR up to time $t$is less than some pre-determined quantity
  $α∈(0,1)$. In thiswork, we present a powerful new framework for online FDR control
  thatwe refer to as “SAFFRON”. Like older alpha-investing algorithms,SAFFRON starts
  off with an error budget (called alpha-wealth) that itintelligently allocates to
  different tests over time, earning backsome alpha-wealth whenever it makes a new
  discovery. However, unlikeolder methods, SAFFRON’s threshold sequence is based on
  a novelestimate of the alpha fraction that it allocates to true nullhypotheses.
  In the offline setting, algorithms that employ an estimateof the proportion of true
  nulls are called “adaptive”, henceSAFFRON can be seen as an online analogue of the
  offlineStorey-BH adaptive procedure. Just as Storey-BH is typically morepowerful
  than the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure underindependence, we demonstrate that
  SAFFRON is also more powerful thanits non-adaptive counterparts such as LORD.
