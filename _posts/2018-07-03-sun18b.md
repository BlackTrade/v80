abstract: Many important datasets in physics, chemistry, and biology consist of noisy
  sequences of images of multiple moving overlapping particles. In many cases, the
  observed particles are indistinguishable, leading to unavoidable uncertainty about
  nearby particles’ identities. Exact Bayesian inference is intractable in this setting,
  and previous approximate Bayesian methods scale poorly. Non-Bayesian approaches
  that output a single “best” estimate of the particle tracks (thus discarding important
  uncertainty information) are therefore dominant in practice. Here we propose a flexible
  and scalable amortized approach for Bayesian inference on this task. We introduce
  a novel neural network method to approximate the (intractable) filter-backward-sample-forward
  algorithm for Bayesian inference in this setting. By varying the simulated training
  data for the network, we can perform inference on a wide variety of data types.
  This approach is therefore highly flexible and improves on the state of the art
  in terms of accuracy; provides uncertainty estimates about the particle locations
  and identities; and has a test run-time that scales linearly as a function of the
  data length and number of particles, thus enabling Bayesian inference in arbitrarily
  large particle tracking datasets.
