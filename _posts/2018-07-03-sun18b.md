abstract: Many important datasets in physics, chemistry,and biology consist of noisy
  sequences of imagesof multiple moving overlapping particles.In many cases, the observed
  particles are indistinguishable,leading to unavoidable uncertaintyabout nearby particles’
  identities. Exact Bayesianinference is intractable in this setting, and previousapproximate
  Bayesian methods scale poorly.Non-Bayesian approaches that output a single“best”
  estimate of the particle tracks (thus discardingimportant uncertainty information)
  aretherefore dominant in practice. Here we proposea flexible and scalable amortized
  approach forBayesian inference on this task. We introducea novel neural network
  method to approximatethe (intractable) filter-backward-sample-forwardalgorithm for
  Bayesian inference in this setting.By varying the simulated training data for the
  network,we can perform inference on a wide varietyof data types. This approach is
  therefore highlyflexible and improves on the state of the art interms of accuracy;
  provides uncertainty estimatesabout the particle locations and identities; and hasa
  test run-time that scales linearly as a functionof the data length and number of
  particles, thusenabling Bayesian inference in arbitrarily largeparticle tracking
  datasets.
