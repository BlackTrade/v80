abstract: We argue that the estimation of mutual information between high dimensional
  continuous random variables can be achieved by gradient descent over neural networks.
  We present a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) that is linearly scalable
  in dimensionality as well as in sample size, trainable through back-prop, and strongly
  consistent. We present a handful of applications on which MINE can be used to minimize
  or maximize mutual information. We apply MINE to improve adversarially trained generative
  models. We also use MINE to implement the Information Bottleneck, applying it to
  supervised classification; our results demonstrate substantial improvement in flexibility
  and performance in these settings.
