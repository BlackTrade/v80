abstract: We develop nested automatic differentiation (AD) algorithms for exact inference
  and learning in integer latent variable models. Recently, Winner, Sujono, and Sheldon
  showed how to reduce marginalization in a class of integer latent variable models
  to evaluating a probability generating function which contains many levels of nested
  high-order derivatives. We contribute faster and more stable AD algorithms for this
  challenging problem and a novel algorithm to compute exact gradients for learning.
  These contributions lead to significantly faster and more accurate learning algorithms,
  and are the first AD algorithms whose running time is polynomial in the number of
  levels of nesting.
