abstract: Recent work has combined Steinâ€™s method with reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space theory to develop nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests for un-normalized probability
  distributions. However, the currently available tests apply exclusively to distributions
  with smooth density functions. In this work, we introduce a kernelized Stein discrepancy
  measure for discrete spaces, and develop a nonparametric goodness-of-fit test for
  discrete distributions with intractable normalization constants. Furthermore, we
  propose a general characterization of Stein operators that encompasses both discrete
  and continuous distributions, providing a recipe for constructing new Stein operators.
  We apply the proposed goodness-of-fit test to three statistical models involving
  discrete distributions, and our experiments show that the proposed test typically
  outperforms a two-sample test based on the maximum mean discrepancy.
