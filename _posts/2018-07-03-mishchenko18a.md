abstract: Distributed learning aims at computing high-quality models by training over
  scattered data. This covers a diversity of scenarios, including computer clusters
  or mobile agents. One of the main challenges is then to deal with heterogeneous
  machines and unreliable communications. In this setting, we propose and analyze
  a flexible asynchronous optimization algorithm for solving nonsmooth learning problems.
  Unlike most existing methods, our algorithm is adjustable to various levels of communication
  costs, machines computational powers, and data distribution evenness. We prove that
  the algorithm converges linearly with a fixed learning rate that does not depend
  on communication delays nor on the number of machines. Although long delays in communication
  may slow down performance, no delay can break convergence.
