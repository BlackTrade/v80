abstract: Two fundamental problems in unsupervised learning are efficient inference
  for latent-variable models and robust density estimation based on large amounts
  of unlabeled data. Algorithms for the two tasks, such as normalizing flows and generative
  adversarial networks (GANs), are often developed independently. In this paper, we
  propose the concept of <em>continuous-time flows</em> (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based
  methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct
  from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals
  in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling
  knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit energy-based
  distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Both tasks rely on a new technique
  for distribution matching within amortized learning. Experiments on various tasks
  demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related
  techniques.
