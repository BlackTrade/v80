abstract: Two methods are proposed for high-dimensional shape-constrained regression
  and classification. These methods reshape pre-trained prediction rules to satisfy
  shape constraints like monotonicity and convexity. The first method can be applied
  to any pre-trained prediction rule, while the second method deals specifically with
  random forests. In both cases, efficient algorithms are developed for computing
  the estimators, and experiments are performed to demonstrate their performance on
  four datasets. We find that reshaping methods enforce shape constraints without
  compromising predictive accuracy.
