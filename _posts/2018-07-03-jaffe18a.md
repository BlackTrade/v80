abstract: Latent variable models with hidden binary units appear in various applications.
  Learning such models, in particular in the presence of noise, is a challenging computational
  problem. In this paper we propose a novel spectral approach to this problem, based
  on the eigenvectors of both the second order moment matrix and third order moment
  tensor of the observed data. We prove that undermild non-degeneracy conditions,
  our method consistently estimates the model parameters at the optimal parametric
  rate. Our tensor-based methodgeneralizes previous orthogonal tensor decomposition
  approaches, where the hidden units were assumed to be either statistically independent
  ormutually exclusive. We illustrate the consistency of our method on simulated data
  and demonstrate its usefulness in learning a common model forpopulation mixtures
  in genetics.
