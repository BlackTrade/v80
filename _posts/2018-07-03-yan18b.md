abstract: 'Complex performance measures, beyond the popular measure of accuracy, are
  increasingly being used in the context of binary classification. These complex performance
  measures are typically not even decomposable, that is, the loss evaluated on a batch
  of samples cannot typically be expressed as a sum or average of losses evaluated
  at individual samples, which in turn requires new theoretical and methodological
  developments beyond standard treatments of supervised learning. In this paper, we
  advance this understanding of binary classification for complex performance measures
  by identifying two key properties: a so-called Karmic property, and a more technical
  threshold-quasi-concavity property, which we show is milder than existing structural
  assumptions imposed on performance measures. Under these properties, we show that
  the Bayes optimal classifier is a threshold function of the conditional probability
  of positive class. We then leverage this result to come up with a computationally
  practical plug-in classifier, via a novel threshold estimator, and further, provide
  a novel statistical analysis of classification error with respect to complex performance
  measures.'
