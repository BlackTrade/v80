abstract: We consider the problem of including additional knowledge in estimating
  sparse Gaussian graphical models (sGGMs) from aggregated samples, arising often
  in bioinformatics and neuroimaging applications. Previous joint sGGM estimators
  either fail to use existing knowledge or cannot scale-up to many tasks (large $K$)
  under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation. In this paper, we propose a novel
  \underlineJoint \underlineElementary \underlineEstimator incorporating additional
  \underlineKnowledge (JEEK) to infer multiple related sparse Gaussian Graphical models
  from large-scale heterogeneous data. Using domain knowledge as weights, we design
  a novel hybrid norm as the minimization objective to enforce the superposition of
  two weighted sparsity constraints, one on the shared interactions and the other
  on the task-specific structural patterns. This enables JEEK to elegantly consider
  various forms of existing knowledge based on the domain at hand and avoid the need
  to design knowledge-specific optimization. JEEK is solved through a fast and entry-wise
  parallelizable solution that largely improves the computational efficiency of the
  state-of-the-art $O(p^5K^4)$ to $O(p^2K^4)$. We conduct a rigorous statistical analysis
  showing that JEEK achieves the same convergence rate $O(\log(Kp)/n_tot)$ as the
  state-of-the-art estimators that are much harder to compute. Empirically, on multiple
  synthetic datasets and one real-world data from neuroscience, JEEP outperforms the
  speed of the state-of-arts significantly while achieving the same level of prediction
  accuracy.
