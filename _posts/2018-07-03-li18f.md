abstract: We study the complexity of the entire regularization path for least squaresregression
  with 1-norm penalty, known as the Lasso. Every regressionparameter in the Lasso
  changes linearly as a function of the regularizationvalue. The number of changes
  is regarded as the Lasso’s complexity.Experimental results using exact path following
  exhibitpolynomial complexity of the Lasso in the problem size. Alas, the pathcomplexity
  of the Lasso on artificially designed regression problems isexponentialWe use smoothed
  analysis as a mechanism for bridging the gapbetween worst case settings and the
  de facto low complexity. Our analysisassumes that the observed data has a tiny amount
  of intrinsic noise.We then prove that the Lasso’s complexity is polynomial in the
  problem size.
