abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully used to solve many continuous
  control tasks. Despite its impressive results however, fundamental questions regarding
  the sample complexity of RL on continuous problems remain open. We study the performance
  of RL in this setting by considering the behavior of the Least-Squares Temporal
  Difference (LSTD) estimator on the classic Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem
  from optimal control. We give the first finite-time analysis of the number of samples
  needed to estimate the value function for a fixed static state-feedback policy to
  within epsilon-relative error. In the process of deriving our result, we give a
  general characterization for when the minimum eigenvalue of the empirical covariance
  matrix formed along the sample path of a fast-mixing stochastic process concentrates
  above zero, extending a result by Koltchinskii and Mendelson in the independent
  covariates setting. Finally, we provide experimental evidence indicating that our
  analysis correctly captures the qualitative behavior of LSTD on several LQR instances.
