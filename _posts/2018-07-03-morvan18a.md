abstract: Learning sparse linear models with two-way interactions is desirable in
  many application domains such as genomics. $\ell_1$-regularised linear models are
  popular to estimate sparse models, yet standard implementations fail to address
  specifically the quadratic explosion of candidate two-way interactions in high dimensions,
  and typically do not scale to genetic data with hundreds of thousands of features.
  Here we present WHInter, a working set algorithm to solve large $\ell_1$-regularised
  problems with two-way interactions for binary design matrices. The novelty of WHInter
  stems from a new bound to efficiently identify working sets while avoiding to scan
  all features, and on fast computations inspired from solutions to the maximum inner
  product search problem. We apply WHInter to simulated and real genetic data and
  show that it is more scalable and two orders of magnitude faster than the state
  of the art.
