abstract: Depth is one of the keys that make neural networks succeed in the task of
  large-scale image recognition. The state-of-the-art network architectures usually
  increase the depths by cascading convolutional layers or building blocks. In this
  paper, we present an alternative method to increase the depth. Our method is by
  introducing computation orderings to the channels within convolutional layers or
  blocks, based on which we gradually compute the outputs in a channel-wise manner.
  The added orderings not only increase the depths and the learning capacities of
  the networks without any additional computation costs, but also eliminate the overlap
  singularities so that the networks are able to converge faster and perform better.
  Experiments show that the networks based on our method achieve the state-of-the-art
  performances on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.
