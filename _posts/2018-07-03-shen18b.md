abstract: We propose a novel algorithmic framework of Variable Metric Over-Relaxed
  Hybrid Proximal Extra-gradient (VMOR-HPE) method with a global convergence guarantee
  for the maximal monotone operator inclusion problem. Its iteration complexities
  and local linear convergence rate are provided, which theoretically demonstrate
  that a large over-relaxed step-size contributes to accelerating the proposed VMOR-HPE
  as a byproduct. Specifically, we find that a large class of primal and primal-dual
  operator splitting algorithms are all special cases of VMOR-HPE. Hence, the proposed
  framework offers a new insight into these operator splitting algorithms. In addition,
  we apply VMOR-HPE to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) generalized equation of linear
  equality constrained multi-block composite convex optimization, yielding a new algorithm,
  namely nonsymmetric Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with a
  preconditioned Extra-gradient step in which the preconditioned metric is generated
  by a blockwise Barzilai-Borwein line search technique (PADMM-EBB). We also establish
  iteration complexities of PADMM-EBB in terms of the KKT residual. Finally, we apply
  PADMM-EBB to handle the nonnegative dual graph regularized low-rank representation
  problem. Promising results on synthetic and real datasets corroborate the efficacy
  of PADMM-EBB.
