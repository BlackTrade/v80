abstract: We introduce a kernel approximation strategy that enables computation of
  the Gaussian process log marginal likelihood and all hyperparameter derivatives
  in O(p) time. Our GRIEF kernel consists of p eigenfunctions found using a Nystr{รถ}m
  approximation from a dense Cartesian product grid of inducing points. By exploiting
  algebraic properties of Kronecker and Khatri-Rao tensor products, computational
  complexity of the training procedure can be practically independent of the number
  of inducing points. This allows us to use arbitrarily many inducing points to achieve
  a globally accurate kernel approximation, even in high-dimensional problems. The
  fast likelihood evaluation enables type-I or II Bayesian inference on large-scale
  datasets. We benchmark our algorithms on real-world problems with up to two-million
  training points and 10^33 inducing points.
