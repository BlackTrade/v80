abstract: 'Based on the predictive coding theory in neuro- science, we designed a
  bi-directional and recur- rent neural net, namely deep predictive coding networks
  (PCN), that has feedforward, feedback, and recurrent connections. Feedback connections
  from a higher layer carry the prediction of its lower-layer representation; feedforward
  connec- tions carry the prediction errors to its higher-layer. Given image input,
  PCN runs recursive cycles of bottom-up and top-down computation to update its internal
  representations and reduce the differ- ence between bottom-up input and top-down
  pre- diction at every layer. After multiple cycles of recursive updating, the representation
  is used for image classification. With benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and
  MNIST), PCN was found to always outperform its feedforward-only counterpart: a model
  without any mechanism for recurrent dynamics, and its performance tended to improve
  given more cycles of computation over time. In short, PCN reuses a single architecture
  to recursively run bottom-up and top-down pro- cesses to refine its representation
  towards more accurate and definitive object recognition.'
