abstract: Gradient-based meta-learning methods leverage gradient descent to learn
  the commonalities among various tasks. While previous such methods have been successful
  in meta-learning tasks, they resort to simple gradient descent during meta-testing.
  Our primary contribution is the <em>MT-net</em>, which enables the meta-learner
  to learn on each layer’s activation space a subspace that the task-specific learner
  performs gradient descent on. Additionally, a task-specific learner of an <em>MT-net</em>
  performs gradient descent with respect to a meta-learned distance metric, which
  warps the activation space to be more sensitive to task identity. We demonstrate
  that the dimension of this learned subspace reflects the complexity of the task-specific
  learner’s adaptation task, and also that our model is less sensitive to the choice
  of initial learning rates than previous gradient-based meta-learning methods. Our
  method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on few-shot classification
  and regression tasks.
