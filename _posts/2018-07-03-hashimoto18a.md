abstract: Machine learning models (e.g., speech recognizers) trained on average loss
  suffer from representation disparityâ€”minority groups (e.g., non-native speakers)
  carry less weight in the training objective, and thus tend to suffer higher loss.Worse,
  as model accuracy affects user retention, a minority group can shrink over time.
  In this paper, we first show that the status quo of empirical risk minimization
  (ERM) amplifies representation disparity over time, which can even turn initially
  fair models unfair. To mitigate this, we develop an approach based on distributionally
  robust optimization (DRO), which minimizes the worst case risk over all distributions
  close to the empirical distribution. We prove that this approach controls the risk
  of the minority group at each time step, in the spirit of Rawlsian distributive
  justice, while remaining oblivious to the identity of the groups. We demonstrate
  that DRO prevents disparity amplification on examples where ERM fails, and show
  improvements in minority group user satisfaction in a real-world text autocomplete
  task.
