abstract: Many advanced Learning from Demonstration (LfD) methods consider the decomposition
  of complex, real-world tasks into simpler sub-tasks.By reusing the corresponding
  sub-policies within and between tasks, we can provide training data for each policy
  from different high-level tasks and compose them to perform novel ones.Existing
  approaches to modular LfD focus either on learning a single high-level task or depend
  on domain knowledge and temporal segmentation. In contrast, we propose a weakly
  supervised, domain-agnostic approach based on task sketches, which include only
  the sequence of sub-tasks performed in each demonstration. Our approachsimultaneously
  aligns the sketches with the observed demonstrations and learns the required sub-policies.
  This improves generalisation in comparison to separate optimisation procedures.We
  evaluate the approach on multiple domains, including a simulated 3D robot arm control
  task using purely image-based observations. The results show that our approach performs
  commensurately with fully supervised approaches, while requiring significantly less
  annotation effort.
