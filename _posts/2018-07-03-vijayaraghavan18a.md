abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are the most widely used statistical model
  for the k-means clustering problem and form a popular framework for clustering in
  machine learning and data analysis. In this paper, we propose a natural robust model
  for k-means clustering that generalizes the Gaussian mixture model, and that we
  believe will be useful in identifying robust algorithms. Our first contribution
  is a polynomial time algorithm that provably recovers the ground-truth up to small
  classification error w.h.p., assuming certain separation between the components.
  Perhaps surprisingly, the algorithm we analyze is the popular Lloydâ€™s algorithm
  for k-means clustering that is the method-of-choice in practice. Our second result
  complements the upper bound by giving a nearly matching lower bound on the number
  of misclassified points incurred by any k-means clustering algorithm on the semi-random
  model.
