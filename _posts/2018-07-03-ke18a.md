abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms have obtained
  state-of-the-art results for many sequence processing tasks. Most of these models
  use a simple form of encoder with attention that looks over the entire sequence
  and assigns a weight to each token independently. We present a mechanism for focusing
  RNN encoders for sequence modelling tasks which allows them to attend to key parts
  of the input as needed. We formulate this using a multi-layer conditional hierarchical
  sequence encoder that reads in one token at a time and makes a discrete decision
  on whether the token is relevant to the context or question being asked. The discrete
  gating mechanism takes in the context embedding and the current hidden state as
  inputs and controls information flow into the layer above. We train it using policy
  gradient methods. We evaluate this method on several types of tasks with different
  attributes. First, we evaluate the method on synthetic tasks which allow us to evaluate
  the model for its generalization ability and probe the behavior of the gates in
  more controlled settings. We then evaluate this approach on large scale Question
  Answering tasks including the challenging MS MARCO and SearchQA tasks. Our models
  shows consistent improvements for both tasks over prior work and our baselines.
  It has also shown to generalize significantly better on synthetic tasks as compared
  to the baselines.
