abstract: Unlike humans, who are capable of continuallearning over their lifetimes,
  artificial neural networkshave long been known to suffer from aphenomenon known
  as catastrophic forgetting,whereby new learning can lead to abrupt erasureof previously
  acquired knowledge. Whereas in aneural network the parameters are typically modelledas
  scalar values, an individual synapse inthe brain comprises a complex network of
  interactingbiochemical components that evolve at differenttimescales. In this paper,
  we show that byequipping tabular and deep reinforcement learningagents with a synaptic
  model that incorporatesthis biological complexity (Benna & Fusi, 2016),catastrophic
  forgetting can be mitigated at multipletimescales. In particular, we find that as
  wellas enabling continual learning across sequentialtraining of two simple tasks,
  it can also be used toovercome within-task forgetting by reducing theneed for an
  experience replay database.
