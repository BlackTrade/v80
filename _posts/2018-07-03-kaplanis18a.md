abstract: Unlike humans, who are capable of continual learning over their lifetimes,
  artificial neural networks have long been known to suffer from a phenomenon known
  as catastrophic forgetting, whereby new learning can lead to abrupt erasure of previously
  acquired knowledge. Whereas in a neural network the parameters are typically modelled
  as scalar values, an individual synapse in the brain comprises a complex network
  of interacting biochemical components that evolve at different timescales. In this
  paper, we show that by equipping tabular and deep reinforcement learning agents
  with a synaptic model that incorporates this biological complexity (Benna & Fusi,
  2016), catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated at multiple timescales. In particular,
  we find that as well as enabling continual learning across sequential training of
  two simple tasks, it can also be used to overcome within-task forgetting by reducing
  the need for an experience replay database.
