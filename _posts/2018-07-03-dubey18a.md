abstract: What makes humans so good at solving seemingly complex video games? Unlike
  computers, humans bring in a great deal of prior knowledge about the world, enabling
  efficient decision making. This paper investigates the role of human priors for
  solving video games. Given a sample game, we conduct a series of ablation studies
  to quantify the importance of various priors on human performance. We do this by
  modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual
  information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some
  prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players
  solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results
  indicate that general priors, such as the importance of objects and visual consistency,
  are critical for efficient game-play. Videos and the game manipulations are available
