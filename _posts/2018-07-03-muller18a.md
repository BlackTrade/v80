abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel neural network architecture, in which
  weight matrices are re-parametrized in terms of low-dimensional vectors, interacting
  through kernel functions. A layer of our network can be interpreted as introducing
  a (potentially infinitely wide) linear layer between input and output. We describe
  the theory underpinning this model and validate it with concrete examples, exploring
  how it can be used to impose structure on neural networks in diverse applications
  ranging from data visualization to recommender systems. We achieve state-of-the-art
  performance in a collaborative filtering task (MovieLens).
