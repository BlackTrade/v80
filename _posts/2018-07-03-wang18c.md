abstract: Motivated by safety-critical applications, test-time attacks on classifiers
  via adversarial examples has recently received a great deal of attention. However,
  there is a general lack of understanding on why adversarial examples arise; whether
  they originate due to inherent properties of data or due to lack of training samples
  remains ill-understood. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework analogous
  to bias-variance theory for understanding these effects. We use our framework to
  analyze the robustness of a canonical non-parametric classifier – the k-nearest
  neighbors. Our analysis shows that its robustness properties depend critically on
  the value of k – the classifier may be inherently non-robust for small k, but its
  robustness approaches that of the Bayes Optimal classifier for fast-growing k. We
  propose a novel modified 1-nearest neighbor classifier, and guarantee its robustness
  in the large sample limit. Our experiments suggest that this classifier may have
  good robustness properties even for reasonable data set sizes.
