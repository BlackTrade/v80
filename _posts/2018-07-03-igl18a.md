abstract: Many real-world sequential decision making problems are partially observable
  by nature, and the environment model is typically unknown. Consequently, there is
  great need for reinforcement learning methods that can tackle such problems given
  only a stream of rewards and incomplete and noisy observations. In this paper, we
  propose deep variational reinforcement learning (DVRL), which introduces an inductive
  bias that allows an agent to learn a generative model of the environment and perform
  inference in that model to effectively aggregate the available information. We develop
  an n-step approximation to the evidence lower bound (ELBO), allowing the model to
  be trained jointly with the policy. This ensures that the latent state representation
  is suitable for the control task. In experiments on Mountain Hike and flickering
  Atari we show that our method outperforms previous approaches relying on recurrent
  neural networks to encode the past.
