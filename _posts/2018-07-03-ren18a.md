abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to be very powerful modeling tools
  for many supervised learning tasks involving complex input patterns. However, they
  can also easily overfit to training set biases and label noises. In addition to
  various regularizers, example reweighting algorithms are popular solutions to these
  problems, but they require careful tuning of additional hyperparameters, such as
  example mining schedules and regularization hyperparameters. In contrast to past
  reweighting methods, which typically consist of functions of the cost value of each
  example, in this work we propose a novel meta-learning algorithm that learns to
  assign weights to training examples based on their gradient directions. To determine
  the example weights, our method performs a meta gradient descent step on the current
  mini-batch example weights (which are initialized from zero) to minimize the loss
  on a clean unbiased validation set. Our proposed method can be easily implemented
  on any type of deep network, does not require any additional hyperparameter tuning,
  and achieves impressive performance on class imbalance and corrupted label problems
  where only a small amount of clean validation data is available.
