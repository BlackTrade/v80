abstract: The problem of minimizing sum-of-nonconvex functions (i.e., convex functions
  that are average of non-convex ones) is becoming increasing important in machine
  learning, and is the core machinery for PCA, SVD, regularized Newtonâ€™s method, accelerated
  non-convex optimization, and more. We show how to provably obtain an accelerated
  stochastic algorithm for minimizing sum-of-nonconvex functions, by adding one additional
  line to the well-known SVRG method. This line corresponds to momentum, and shows
  how to directly apply momentum to the finite-sum stochastic minimization of sum-of-nonconvex
  functions. As a side result, our method enjoys linear parallel speed-up using mini-batch.
