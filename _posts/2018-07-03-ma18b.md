abstract: We consider worker skill estimation for the single coin Dawid-Skene crowdsourcing
  model. In practice skill-estimation is challenging because worker assignments are
  sparse and irregular due to the arbitrary, and uncontrolled availability of workers.
  We formulate skill estimation as a rank-one correlation-matrix completion problem,
  where the observed components correspond to observed label correlation between workers.
  We show that the correlation matrix can be successfully recovered and skills identifiable
  if and only if the sampling matrix (observed components) is irreducible and aperiodic.
  We then propose an efficient gradient descent scheme and show that skill estimates
  converges to the desired global optima for such sampling matrices. Our proof is
  original and the results are surprising in light of the fact that even the weighted
  rank-one matrix factorization problem is NP hard in general. Next we derive sample
  complexity bounds for the noisy case in terms of spectral properties of the signless
  Laplacian of the sampling matrix. Our proposed scheme achieves state-of-art performance
  on a number of real-world datasets.
