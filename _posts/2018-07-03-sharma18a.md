abstract: We present an alternate formulation of the partial assignment problem as
  matching random clique complexes, that are higher-order analogues of random graphs,
  designed to provide a set of invariants that better detect higher-order structure.
  The proposed method creates random clique adjacency matrices for each k-skeleton
  of the random clique complexes and matches them, taking into account each point
  as the affine combination of its geometric neighborhood. We justify our solution
  theoretically, by analyzing the runtime and storage complexity of our algorithm
  along with the asymptotic behavior of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that
  is associated with the underlying random clique adjacency matrices. Experiments
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets, containing severe occlusions and distortions,
  provide insight into the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of our approach. We
  outperform diverse matching algorithms by a significant margin.
