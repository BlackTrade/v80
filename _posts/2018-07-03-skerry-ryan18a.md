abstract: We present an extension to the Tacotron speech synthesis architecture that
  learns a latent embedding space of prosody, derived from a reference acoustic representation
  containing the desired prosody. We show that conditioning Tacotron on this learned
  embedding space results in synthesized audio that matches the prosody of the reference
  signal with fine time detail even when the reference and synthesis speakers are
  different. Additionally, we show that a reference prosody embedding can be used
  to synthesize text that is different from that of the reference utterance. We define
  several quantitative and subjective metrics for evaluating prosody transfer, and
  report results with accompanying audio samples from single-speaker and 44-speaker
  Tacotron models on a prosody transfer task.
