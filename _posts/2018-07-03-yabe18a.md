abstract: Bandit is a framework for designing sequential experiments, where a learner
  selects an arm $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and obtains an observation corresponding to $A$
  in each experiment. Theoretically, the tight regret lower-bound for the general
  bandit is polynomial with respect to the number of arms $|\mathcal{A}|$, and thus,
  to overcome this bound, the bandit problem with side-information is often considered.
  Recently, a bandit framework over a causal graph was introduced, where the structure
  of the causal graph is available as side-information and the arms are identified
  with interventions on the causal graph. Existing algorithms for causal bandit overcame
  the $\Omega(\sqrt{|\mathcal{A}|/T})$ simple-regret lower-bound; however, their algorithms
  work only when the interventions $\mathcal{A}$ are localized around a single node
  (i.e., an intervention propagates only to its neighbors). We then propose a novel
  causal bandit algorithm for an arbitrary set of interventions, which can propagate
  throughout the causal graph. We also show that it achieves $O(\sqrt{ \gamma^*\log(|\mathcal{A}|T)
  / T})$ regret bound, where $\gamma^*$ is determined by using a causal graph structure.
  In particular, if the maximum in-degree of the causal graph is a constant, then
  $\gamma^* = O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes.
