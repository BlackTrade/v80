abstract: Random feature maps are ubiquitous in modern statistical machine learning,
  where they generalize random projections by means of powerful, yet often difficult
  to analyze nonlinear operators. In this paper we leverage the "concentration" phenomenon
  induced by random matrix theory to perform a spectral analysis on the Gram matrix
  of these random feature maps, here for Gaussian mixture models of simultaneously
  large dimension and size. Our results are instrumental to a deeper understanding
  on the interplay of the nonlinearity and the statistics of the data, thereby allowing
  for a better tuning of random feature-based techniques.
