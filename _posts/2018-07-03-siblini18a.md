abstract: Extreme Multi-label Learning (XML) considers large sets of items described
  by a number of labels that can exceed one million. Tree-based methods, which hierarchically
  partition the problem into small scale sub-problems, are particularly promising
  in this context to reduce the learning/prediction complexity and to open the way
  to parallelization. However, the current best approaches do not exploit tree randomization
  which has shown its efficiency in random forests and they resort to complex partitioning
  strategies. To overcome these limits, we here introduce a new random forest based
  algorithm with a very fast partitioning approach called CRAFTML. Experimental comparisons
  on nine datasets from the XML literature show that it outperforms the other tree-based
  approaches. Moreover with a parallelized implementation reduced to five cores, it
  is competitive with the best state-of-the-art methods which run on one hundred-core
  machines.
