abstract: In this paper, we consider statistical learning with AUC (area under ROC
  curve) maximization in the classical stochastic setting where one random data drawn
  from an unknown distribution is revealed at each iteration for updating the model.
  Although consistent convex surrogate losses for AUC maximization have been proposed
  to make the problem tractable, it remains an challenging problem to design fast
  optimization algorithms in the classical stochastic setting due to that the convex
  surrogate loss depends on random pairs of examples from positive and negative classes.
  Building on a saddle point formulation for a consistent square loss, this paper
  proposes a novel stochastic algorithm to improve the standard $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ convergence
  rate to $\widetilde O(1/n)$ convergence rate without strong convexity assumption
  or any favorable statistical assumptions (e.g., low noise), where $n$ is the number
  of random samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stochastic algorithm
  for AUC maximization with a statistical convergence rate as fast as $O(1/n)$ up
  to a logarithmic factor. Extensive experiments on eight large-scale benchmark data
  sets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm comparing with
  existing stochastic or online algorithms for AUC maximization.
