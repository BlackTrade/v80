abstract: This paper studies the problem of nonparametric estimation of a smooth function
  with data distributed across multiple machines. We assume an independent sample
  from a white noise model is collected at each machine, and an estimator of the underlying
  true function needs to be constructed at a central machine. We place limits on the
  number of bits that each machine can use to transmit information to the central
  machine. Our results give both asymptotic lower bounds and matching upper bounds
  on the statistical risk under various settings. We identify three regimes, depending
  on the relationship among the number of machines, the size of data available at
  each machine, and the communication budget. When the communication budget is small,
  the statistical risk depends solely on this communication bottleneck, regardless
  of the sample size. In the regime where the communication budget is large, the classic
  minimax risk in the non-distributed estimation setting is recovered. In an intermediate
  regime, the statistical risk depends on both the sample size and the communication
  budget.
