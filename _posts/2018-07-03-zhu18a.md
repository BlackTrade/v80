abstract: This paper studies the problem of nonparametric estimation of a smoothfunction
  with data distributed across multiple machines. We assume anindependent sample from
  a white noise model is collected at eachmachine, and an estimator of the underlying
  true function needs to beconstructed at a central machine. We place limits on the
  number ofbits that each machine can use to transmit information to the centralmachine.
  Our results give both asymptotic lower bounds and matchingupper bounds on the statistical
  risk under various settings. Weidentify three regimes, depending on the relationship
  among the numberof machines, the size of data available at each machine, and thecommunication
  budget. When the communication budget is small, thestatistical risk depends solely
  on this communication bottleneck,regardless of the sample size. In the regime where
  the communicationbudget is large, the classic minimax risk in the non-distributedestimation
  setting is recovered. In an intermediate regime, thestatistical risk depends on
  both the sample size and the communicationbudget.
