abstract: 'Our goal is for AI systems to correctly identify and act according to their
  human user’s objectives. Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL) formalizes
  this value alignment problem as a two-player game between a human and robot, in
  which only the human knows the parameters of the reward function: the robot needs
  to learn them as the interaction unfolds. Previous work showed that CIRL can be
  solved as a POMDP, but with an action space size exponential in the size of the
  reward parameter space. In this work, we exploit a specific property of CIRL: the
  human is a full information agent. This enables us to derive an optimality-preserving
  modification to the standard Bellman update, which reduces the complexity of the
  problem by an exponential factor. Additionally, we show that our modified Bellman
  update allows us to relax CIRL’s assumption of human rationality. We apply this
  update to a variety of POMDP solvers, including exact methods, point-based methods,
  and Monte Carlo Tree Search methods. We find that it enables us to scale CIRL to
  non-trivial problems, with larger reward parameter spaces, and larger action spaces
  for both robot and human. In solutions to these larger problems, the human exhibits
  pedagogical (teaching) behavior, while the robot interprets it as such and attains
  higher value for the human.'
