abstract: This paper considers the generation of prediction intervals (PIs) by neural
  networks for quantifying uncertainty in regression tasks. It is axiomatic that high-quality
  PIs should be as narrow as possible, whilst capturing a specified portion of data.
  We derive a loss function directly from this axiom that requires no distributional
  assumption. We show how its form derives from a likelihood principle, that it can
  be used with gradient descent, and that model uncertainty is accounted for in ensembled
  form. Benchmark experiments show the method outperforms current state-of-the-art
  uncertainty quantification methods, reducing average PI width by over 10%.
