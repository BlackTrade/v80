abstract: 'We provide convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for a variety
  of variance-reduction methods: SAGA Langevin diffusion, SVRG Langevin diffusion
  and control-variate underdamped Langevin diffusion. We analyze these methods under
  a uniform set of assumptions on the log-posterior distribution, assuming it to be
  smooth, strongly convex and Hessian Lipschitz. This is achieved by a new proof technique
  combining ideas from finite-sum optimization and the analysis of sampling methods.
  Our sharp theoretical bounds allow us to identify regimes of interest where each
  method performs better than the others. Our theory is verified with experiments
  on real-world and synthetic datasets.'
