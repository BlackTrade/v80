abstract: We analyze the variance of stochastic gradients along negative curvature
  directions in certain non-convex machine learning models and show that stochastic
  gradients indeed exhibit a strong component along these directions. Furthermore,
  we show that - contrary to the case of isotropic noise - this variance is proportional
  to the magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalues and not decreasing in the dimensionality.
  Based upon this bservation we propose a new assumption under which we show that
  the injection of explicit, isotropic noise usually applied to make gradient descent
  escape saddle points can successfully be replaced by a simple SGD step. Additionally
  - and under the same condition - we derive the first convergence rate for plain
  SGD to a second-order stationary point in a number of iterations that is independent
  of the problem dimension.
