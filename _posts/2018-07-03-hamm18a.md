abstract: Minimax optimization plays a key role in adversarial training of machine
  learning algorithms, such as learning generative models, domain adaptation, privacy
  preservation, and robust learning.In this paper, we demonstrate the failure of alternating
  gradient descent in minimax optimization problems due to the discontinuity of solutions
  of the inner maximization. To address this, we propose a new $Îµ$-subgradient descent
  algorithm that addresses this problem by simultaneously tracking $K$ candidate solutions.Practically,
  the algorithm can find solutions that previous saddle-point algorithms cannot find,
  with only a sublinear increase of complexity in $K$. We analyze the conditions under
  which the algorithm converges to the true solution in detail. A significant improvement
  in stability and convergence speed of the algorithm is observed in simple representative
  problems, GAN training, and domain-adaptation problems.
