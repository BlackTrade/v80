abstract: This paper studies semiparametric contextual bandits, a generalization of
  the linear stochastic bandit problem where the reward for a chosen action is modeled
  as a linear function of known action features confounded by a non-linear action-independent
  term. We design new algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret over $T$
  rounds, when the linear function is $d$-dimensional, which matches the best known
  bounds for the simpler unconfounded case and improves on a recent result of Greenwald
  et al. (2017). Via an empirical evaluation, we show that our algorithms outperform
  prior approaches when there are non-linear confounding effects on the rewards. Technically,
  our algorithms use a new reward estimator inspired by doubly-robust approaches and
  our proofs require new concentration inequalities for self-normalized martingales.
