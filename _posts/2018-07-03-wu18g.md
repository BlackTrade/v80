abstract: Off-policy learning, the task of evaluating and improving policies using
  historic data collected from a logging policy, is important because on-policy evaluation
  is usually expensive and has adverse impacts. One of the major challenge of off-policy
  learning is to derive counterfactual estimators that also has low variance and thus
  low generalization error. In this work, inspired by learning bounds for importance
  sampling problems, we present a new counterfactual learning principle for off-policy
  learning with bandit feedbacks. Our method regularizes the generalization error
  by minimizing the distribution divergence between the logging policy and the new
  policy, and removes the need for iterating through all training samples to compute
  sample variance regularization in prior work. With neural network policies, our
  end-to-end training algorithms using variational divergence minimization showed
  significant improvement over conventional baseline algorithms and is also consistent
  with our theoretical results.
