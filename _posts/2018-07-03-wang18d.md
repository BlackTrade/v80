abstract: This paper considers the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in zero-sum
  stochastic games when expert demonstrations are known to be suboptimal. Compared
  to previous works that decouple agents in the game by assuming optimality in expert
  policies, we introduce a new objective function that directly pits experts against
  Nash Equilibrium policies, and we design an algorithm to solve for the reward function
  in the context of inverse reinforcement learning with deep neural networks as model
  approximations. To ?nd Nash Equilibrium in large-scale games, we also propose an
  adversarial training algorithm for zero-sum stochastic games, and show the theoretical
  appeal of non-existence of local optima in its objective function. In numerical
  experiments, we demonstrate that our Nash Equilibrium and inverse reinforcement
  learning algorithms address games that are not amenable to existing benchmark algorithms.
  Moreover, our algorithm successfully recovers reward and policy functions regardless
  of the quality of the sub-optimal expert demonstration set.
