abstract: 'We present a comprehensive understanding of three important problemsin
  PAC preference learning: maximum selection (maxing), ranking, andestimating <em>all</em>
  pairwise preference probabilities, in theadaptive setting. With just Weak Stochastic
  Transitivity, we show thatmaxing requires $Î©(n^2)$ comparisons and with slightly
  morerestrictive Medium Stochastic Transitivity, we present a linearcomplexity maxing
  algorithm. With Strong Stochastic Transitivity andStochastic Triangle Inequality,
  we derive a ranking algorithm withoptimal $\mathcalO(n\log n)$ complexity and an
  optimal algorithmthat estimates all pairwise preference probabilities.'
