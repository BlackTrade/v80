abstract: 'We present a comprehensive understanding of three important problems in
  PAC preference learning: maximum selection (maxing), ranking, and estimating <em>all</em>
  pairwise preference probabilities, in the adaptive setting. With just Weak Stochastic
  Transitivity, we show that maxing requires $\Omega(n^2)$ comparisons and with slightly
  more restrictive Medium Stochastic Transitivity, we present a linear complexity
  maxing algorithm. With Strong Stochastic Transitivity and Stochastic Triangle Inequality,
  we derive a ranking algorithm with optimal $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ complexity and
  an optimal algorithm that estimates all pairwise preference probabilities.'
