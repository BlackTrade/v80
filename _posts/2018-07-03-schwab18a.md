abstract: Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) require constant and close supervision.
  To assist clinical staff in this task, hospitals use monitoring systems that trigger
  audiovisual alarms if their algorithms indicate that a patient’s condition may be
  worsening. However, current monitoring systems are extremely sensitive to movement
  artefacts and technical errors. As a result, they typically trigger hundreds to
  thousands of false alarms per patient per day - drowning the important alarms in
  noise and adding to the exhaustion of clinical staff. In this setting, data is abundantly
  available, but obtaining trustworthy annotations by experts is laborious and expensive.
  We frame the problem of false alarm reduction from multivariate time series as a
  machine-learning task and address it with a novel multitask network architecture
  that utilises distant supervision through multiple related auxiliary tasks in order
  to reduce the number of expensive labels required for training. We show that our
  approach leads to significant improvements over several state-of-the-art baselines
  on real-world ICU data and provide new insights on the importance of task selection
  and architectural choices in distantly supervised multitask learning.
