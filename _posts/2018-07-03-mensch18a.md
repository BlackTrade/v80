abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) solves a variety of structured combinatorial problems
  by iteratively breaking them down into smaller subproblems. In spite of their versatility,
  many DP algorithms are non-differentiable, which hampers their use as a layer in
  neural networks trained by backpropagation. To address this issue, we propose to
  smooth the max operator in the dynamic programming recursion, using a strongly convex
  regularizer. This allows to relax both the optimal value and solution of the original
  combinatorial problem, and turns a broad class of DP algorithms into differentiable
  operators. Theoretically, we provide a new probabilistic perspective on backpropagating
  through these DP operators, and relate them to inference in graphical models. We
  derive two particular instantiations of our framework, a smoothed Viterbi algorithm
  for sequence prediction and a smoothed DTW algorithm for time-series alignment.
  We showcase these instantiations on structured prediction (audio-to-score alignment,
  NER) and on structured and sparse attention for translation.
