abstract: 'We are concerned with the discovery of hierarchical relationships from
  large-scale unstructured similarity scores. For this purpose, we study different
  models of hyperbolic space and find that learning embeddings in the Lorentz model
  is substantially more efficient than in the Poincar{é}-ball model. We show that
  the proposed approach allows us to learn high-quality embeddings of large taxonomies
  which yield improvements over Poincar{é} embeddings, especially in low dimensions.
  Lastly, we apply our model to discover hierarchies in two real-world datasets: we
  show that an embedding in hyperbolic space can reveal important aspects of a company’s
  organizational structure as well as reveal historical relationships between language
  families.'
