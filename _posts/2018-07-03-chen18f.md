abstract: An important task in computational statistics and machine learning is to
  approximate a posterior distribution $p(x)$ with an empirical measure supported
  on a set of representative points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$. This paper focuses on methods
  where the selection of points is essentially deterministic, with an emphasis on
  achieving accurate approximation when $n$ is small. To this end, we present Stein
  Points. The idea is to exploit either a greedy or a conditional gradient method
  to iteratively minimise a kernel Stein discrepancy between the empirical measure
  and $p(x)$. Our empirical results demonstrate that Stein Points enable accurate
  approximation of the posterior at modest computational cost. In addition, theoretical
  results are provided to establish convergence of the method.
