abstract: Information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation techniques have demonstrated
  state-of-the-art performance in tackling important global optimisation problems.
  However, current information-theoretic approaches require many approximations in
  implementation, introduce often-prohibitive computational overhead and limit the
  choice of kernels available to model the objective. We develop a fast information-theoretic
  Bayesian Optimisation method, FITBO, that avoids the need for sampling the global
  minimiser, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, in comparison
  with existing approaches, our method faces fewer constraints on kernel choice and
  enjoys the merits of dealing with the output space. We demonstrate empirically that
  FITBO inherits the performance associated with information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation,
  while being even faster than simpler Bayesian optimisation approaches, such as Expected
  Improvement.
