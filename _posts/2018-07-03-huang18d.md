abstract: Normalizing flows and autoregressive models have been successfully combined
  to produce state-of-the-art results in density estimation, via Masked Autoregressive
  Flows (MAF) (Papamakarios et al., 2017), and to accelerate state-of-the-art WaveNet-based
  speech synthesis to 20x faster than real-time (Oord et al., 2017), via Inverse Autoregressive
  Flows (IAF) (Kingma et al., 2016). We unify and generalize these approaches, replacing
  the (conditionally) affine univariate transformations of MAF/IAF with a more general
  class of invertible univariate transformations expressed as monotonic neural networks.
  We demonstrate that the proposed neural autoregressive flows (NAF) are universal
  approximators for continuous probability distributions, and their greater expressivity
  allows them to better capture multimodal target distributions. Experimentally, NAF
  yields state-of-the-art performance on a suite of density estimation tasks and outperforms
  IAF in variational autoencoders trained on binarized MNIST.
