abstract: We present a VAE architecture for encoding and generating high dimensional
  sequential data, such as video or audio. Our deep generative model learns a latent
  representation of the data which is split into a static and dynamic part, allowing
  us to approximately disentangle latent time-dependent features (dynamics) from features
  which are preserved over time (content). This architecture gives us partial control
  over generating content and dynamics by conditioning on either one of these sets
  of features. In our experiments on artificially generated cartoon video clips and
  voice recordings, we show that we can convert the content of a given sequence into
  another one by such content swapping. For audio, this allows us to convert a male
  speaker into a female speaker and vice versa, while for video we can separately
  manipulate shapes and dynamics. Furthermore, we give empirical evidence for the
  hypothesis that stochastic RNNs as latent state models are more efficient at compressing
  and generating long sequences than deterministic ones, which may be relevant for
  applications in video compression.
