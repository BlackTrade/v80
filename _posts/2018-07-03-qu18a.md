abstract: We investigate a projection free optimization method, namely non-convex
  conditional gradient sliding (NCGS) for non-convex optimization problems on the
  batch, stochastic and finite-sum settings. Conditional gradient sliding (CGS) method,
  by integrating Nesterovâ€™s accelerated gradient method with Frank-Wolfe (FW) method
  in a smart way, outperforms FW for convex optimization, by reducing the amount of
  gradient computations. However, the study of CGS in the non-convex setting is limited.
  In this paper, we propose the non-convex conditional gradient sliding (NCGS) methods
  and analyze their convergence properties. We also leverage the idea of variance
  reduction from the recent progress in convex optimization to obtain a new algorithm
  termed <em>variance reduced NCGS</em> (NCGS-VR), and obtain faster convergence rate
  than the batch NCGS in the finite-sum setting. We show that NCGS algorithms outperform
  their Frank-Wolfe counterparts both in theory and in practice, for all three settings,
  namely the batch, stochastic and finite-sum setting. This significantly improves
  our understanding of optimizing non-convex functions with complicated feasible sets
  (where projection is prohibitively expensive).
