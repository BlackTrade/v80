abstract: Open category detection is the problem of detecting "alien" test instances
  that belong to categories or classes that were not present in the training data.
  In many applications, reliably detecting such aliens is central to ensuring the
  safety and accuracy of test set predictions. Unfortunately, there are no algorithms
  that provide theoretical guarantees on their ability to detect aliens under general
  assumptions. Further, while there are algorithms for open category detection, there
  are few empirical results that directly report alien detection rates. Thus, there
  are significant theoretical and empirical gaps in our understanding of open category
  detection. In this paper, we take a step toward addressing this gap by studying
  a simple, but practically-relevant variant of open category detection. In our setting,
  we are provided with a "clean" training set that contains only the target categories
  of interest and an unlabeled "contaminated‚Äù training set that contains a fraction
  alpha of alien examples. Under the assumption that we know an upper bound on alpha
  we develop an algorithm with PAC-style guarantees on the alien detection rate, while
  aiming to minimize false alarms. Empirical results on synthetic and standard benchmark
  datasets demonstrate the regimes in which the algorithm can be effective and provide
  a baseline for further advancements.
