abstract: Training neural networks involves finding minima of a high-dimensional non-convex
  loss function. Relaxing from linear interpolations, we construct continuous paths
  between minima of recent neural network architectures on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Surprisingly,
  the paths are essentially flat in both the training and test landscapes. This implies
  that minima are perhaps best seen as points on a single connected manifold of low
  loss, rather than as the bottoms of distinct valleys.
