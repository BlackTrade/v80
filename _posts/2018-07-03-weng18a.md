abstract: Verifying the robustness property of a general Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
  network is an NP-complete problem. Although finding the exact minimum adversarial
  distortion is hard, giving a certified lower bound of the minimum distortion is
  possible. Current available methods of computing such a bound are either time-consuming
  or deliver low quality bounds that are too loose to be useful. In this paper, we
  exploit the special structure of ReLU networks and provide two computationally efficient
  algorithms (Fast-Lin, Fast-Lip) that are able to certify non-trivial lower bounds
  of minimum adversarial distortions. Experiments show that (1) our methods deliver
  bounds close to (the gap is 2-3X) exact minimum distortions found by Reluplex in
  small networks while our algorithms are more than 10,000 times faster; (2) our methods
  deliver similar quality of bounds (the gap is within 35% and usually around 10%;
  sometimes our bounds are even better) for larger networks compared to the methods
  based on solving linear programming problems but our algorithms are 33-14,000 times
  faster; (3) our method is capable of solving large MNIST and CIFAR networks up to
  7 layers with more than 10,000 neurons within tens of seconds on a single CPU core.
  In addition, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm that can approximately
  find the minimum $\ell_1$ adversarial distortion of a ReLU network with a $0.99\ln
  n$ approximation ratio unless NP=P, where $n$ is the number of neurons in the network.
