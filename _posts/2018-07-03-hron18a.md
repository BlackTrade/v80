abstract: Dropout, a stochastic regularisation technique for training of neural networks,
  has recently been reinterpreted as a specific type of approximate inference algorithm
  for Bayesian neural networks. The main contribution of the reinterpretation is in
  providing a theoretical framework useful for analysing and extending the algorithm.
  We show that the proposed framework suffers from several issues; from undefined
  or pathological behaviour of the true posterior related to use of improper priors,
  to an ill-defined variational objective due to singularity of the approximating
  distribution relative to the true posterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform
  prior used in variational Gaussian dropout suggests the pathologies are generally
  irredeemable, and that the algorithm still works only because the variational formulation
  annuls some of the pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL
  (QKL) divergence, a new approximate inference objective for approximation of high-dimensional
  distributions. We show that motivations for variational Bernoulli dropout based
  on discretisation and noise have QKL as a limit. Properties of QKL are studied both
  theoretically and on a simple practical example which shows that the QKL-optimal
  approximation of a full rank Gaussian with a degenerate one naturally leads to the Principal
  Component Analysis solution.
