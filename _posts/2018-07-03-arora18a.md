abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning states that increasing depth improves
  expressiveness but complicates optimization. This paper suggests that, sometimes,
  increasing depth can speed up optimization. The effect of depth on optimization
  is decoupled from expressiveness by focusing on settings where additional layers
  amount to overparameterization â€“ linear neural networks, a well-studied model. Theoretical
  analysis, as well as experiments, show that here depth acts as a preconditioner
  which may accelerate convergence. Even on simple convex problems such as linear
  regression with $\ell_p$ loss, $p>2$, gradient descent can benefit from transitioning
  to a non-convex overparameterized objective, more than it would from some common
  acceleration schemes. We also prove that it is mathematically impossible to obtain
  the acceleration effect of overparametrization via gradients of any regularizer.
