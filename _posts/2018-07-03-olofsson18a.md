abstract: Healthcare companies must submit pharmaceutical drugs or medical device
  to regulatory bodies before marketing new technology. Regulatory bodies frequently
  require transparent and interpretable computational modelling to justify a new healthcare
  technology, but researchers may have several competing models for a biological system
  and too little data to discriminate between the models. In design of experiments
  for model discrimination, where the goal is to design maximally informative physical
  experiments in order to discriminate between rival predictive models, research has
  focused either on analytical approaches, which cannot manage all functions, or on
  data-driven approaches, which may have computational difficulties or lack interpretable
  marginal predictive distributions. We develop a methodology for introducing Gaussian
  process surrogates in lieu of the original mechanistic models. This allows us to
  extend existing design and model discrimination methods developed for analytical
  models to cases of non-analytical models.
