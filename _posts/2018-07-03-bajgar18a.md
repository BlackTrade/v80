abstract: We point out important problems with the common practice of using the best
  single model performance for comparing deep learning architectures, and we propose
  a method that corrects these flaws. Each time a model is trained, one gets a different
  result due to random factors in the training process, which include random parameter
  initialization and random data shuffling. Reporting the best single model performance
  does not appropriately address this stochasticity. We propose a normalized expected
  best-out-of-$n$ performance ($\text{Boo}_n$) as a way to correct these problems.
