abstract: 'Program synthesis is a class of regression problems where one seeks a solution,
  in the form of a source-code program, mapping the inputs to their corresponding
  outputs exactly. Due to its precise and combinatorial nature, program synthesis
  is commonly formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem, where input-output
  examples are encoded as constraints and solved with a constraint solver. A key challenge
  of this formulation is scalability: while constraint solvers work well with a few
  well-chosen examples, a large set of examples can incur significant overhead in
  both time and memory. We describe a method to discover a subset of examples that
  is both small and representative: the subset is constructed iteratively, using a
  neural network to predict the probability of unchosen examples conditioned on the
  chosen examples in the subset, and greedily adding the least probable example. We
  empirically evaluate the representativeness of the subsets constructed by our method,
  and demonstrate such subsets can significantly improve synthesis time and stability.'
