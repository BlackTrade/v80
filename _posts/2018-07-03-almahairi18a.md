abstract: Learning inter-domain mappings from unpaired data can improve performance
  in structured prediction tasks, such as image segmentation, by reducing the need
  for paired data. CycleGAN was recently proposed for this problem, but critically
  assumes the underlying inter-domain mapping is approximately deterministic and one-to-one.
  This assumption renders the model ineffective for tasks requiring flexible, many-to-many
  mappings. We propose a new model, called Augmented CycleGAN, which learns many-to-many
  mappings between domains. We examine Augmented CycleGAN qualitatively and quantitatively
  on several image datasets.
