abstract: Feature selection is an important challenge in machine learning. It plays
  a crucial role in the explainability of machine-driven decisions that are rapidly
  permeating throughout modern society. Unfortunately, the explosion in the size and
  dimensionality of real-world datasets poses a severe challenge to standard feature
  selection algorithms. Today, it is not uncommon for datasets to have billions of
  dimensions. At such scale, even storing the feature vector is impossible, causing
  most existing feature selection methods to fail. Workarounds like feature hashing,
  a standard approach to large-scale machine learning, helps with the computational
  feasibility, but at the cost of losing the interpretability of features. In this
  paper, we present MISSION, a novel framework for ultra large-scale feature selection
  that performs stochastic gradient descent while maintaining an efficient representation
  of the features in memory using a Count-Sketch data structure. MISSION retains the
  simplicity of feature hashing without sacrificing the interpretability of the features
  while using only O(log^2(p)) working memory. We demonstrate that MISSION accurately
  and efficiently performs feature selection on real-world, large-scale datasets with
  billions of dimensions.
