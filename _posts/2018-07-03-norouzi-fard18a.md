abstract: Many tasks in machine learning and data mining, such as data diversification,
  non-parametric learning, kernel machines, clustering etc., require extracting a
  small but representative summary from a massive dataset. Often, such problems can
  be posed as maximizing a submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint.
  We consider this question in the streaming setting, where elements arrive over time
  at a fast pace and thuswe need to design an efficient, low-memory algorithm. One
  such method, proposed by Badanidiyuru et al. (2014), always finds a 0.5-approximate
  solution. Can this approximation factor be improved? We answer this question affirmatively
  by designing a new algorithm Salsa for streaming submodular maximization. It is
  the first low-memory, singlepass algorithm that improves the factor 0.5, under the
  natural assumption that elementsarrive in a random order. We also show that this
  assumption is necessary, i.e., that there is no such algorithm with better than
  0.5-approximation when elements arrive in arbitrary order. Our experiments demonstrate
  that Salsa significantly outperforms the state of the art in applications related
  to exemplar-based clustering, social graph analysis, and recommender systems.
