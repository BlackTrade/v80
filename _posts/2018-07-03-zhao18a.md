abstract: One important task of topic modeling for text analysis is interpretability.
  By discovering structured topics one is able to yield improved interpretability
  as well as modeling accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model with
  a deep structure that explores both inter-topic and intra-topic structures informed
  by word embeddings. Specifically, our model discovers inter topic structures in
  the form of topic hierarchies and discovers intra topic structures in the form of
  sub-topics, each of which is informed by word embeddings and captures a fine-grained
  thematic aspect of a normal topic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
  achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of perplexity, document classification,
  and topic quality. Moreover, with topic hierarchies and sub-topics, the topics discovered
  in our model are more interpretable, providing an illuminating means to understand
  text data.
