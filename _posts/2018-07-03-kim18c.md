abstract: Prediction suffix trees (PST) provide an effective tool for sequence modelling
  and prediction. Current prediction techniques for PSTs rely on exact matching between
  the suffix of the current sequence and the previously observed sequence. We present
  a provably correct algorithm for learning a PST with approximate suffix matching
  by relaxing the exact matching condition. We then present a self-bounded enhancement
  of our algorithm where the depth of suffix tree grows automatically in response
  to the model performance on a training sequence. Through experiments on synthetic
  datasets as well as three real-world datasets, we show that the approximate matching
  PST results in better predictive performance than the other variants of PST.
