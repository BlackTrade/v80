abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) consists of a nonlinear transformation from
  an input to a feature representation, followed by a common softmax linear classifier.
  Though many efforts have been devoted to designing a proper architecture for nonlinear
  transformation, little investigation has been done on the classifier part. In this
  paper, we show that a properly designed classifier can improve robustness to adversarial
  attacks and lead to better prediction results. Specifically, we define a Max-Mahalanobis
  distribution (MMD) and theoretically show that if the input distributes as a MMD,
  the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier will have the best robustness
  to adversarial examples. We further propose a novel Max-Mahalanobis linear discriminant
  analysis (MM-LDA) network, which explicitly maps a complicated data distribution
  in the input space to a MMD in the latent feature space and then applies LDA to
  make predictions. Our results demonstrate that the MM-LDA networks are significantly
  more robust to adversarial attacks, and have better performance in class-biased
  classification.
