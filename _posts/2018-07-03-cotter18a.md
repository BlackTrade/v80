abstract: 'We introduce the problem of grouping a finite ground set into blocks where
  each block is a subset of the ground set and where: (i) the blocks are individually
  highly valued by a submodular function (both robustly and in the average case) while
  satisfying block-specific matroid constraints; and (ii) block scores interact where
  blocks are jointly scored highly, thus making the blocks mutually non-redundant.
  Submodular functions are good models of information and diversity; thus, the above
  can be seen as grouping the ground set into matroid constrained blocks that are
  both intra- and inter-diverse. Potential applications include forming ensembles
  of classification/regression models, partitioning data for parallel processing,
  and summarization. In the non-robust case, we reduce the problem to non-monotone
  submodular maximization subject to multiple matroid constraints. In the mixed robust/average
  case, we offer a bi-criterion guarantee for a polynomial time deterministic algorithm
  and a probabilistic guarantee for randomized algorithm, as long as the involved
  submodular functions (including the inter-block interaction terms) are monotone.
  We close with a case study in which we use these algorithms to find high quality
  diverse ensembles of classifiers, showing good results.'
