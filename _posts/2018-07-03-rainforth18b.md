abstract: 'We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that using tighter evidence
  lower bounds (ELBOs) can be detrimental to the process of learning an inference
  network by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of the gradient estimator. Our results
  call into question common implicit assumptions that tighter ELBOs are better variational
  objectives for simultaneous model learning and inference amortization schemes. Based
  on our insights, we introduce three new algorithms: the partially importance weighted
  auto-encoder (PIWAE), the multiply importance weighted auto-encoder (MIWAE), and
  the combination importance weighted autoencoder (CIWAE), each of which includes
  the standard importance weighted auto-encoder (IWAE) as a special case. We show
  that each can deliver improvements over IWAE, even when performance is measured
  by the IWAE target itself. Furthermore, our results suggest that PIWAE may be able
  to deliver simultaneous improvements in the training of both the inference and generative
  networks.'
