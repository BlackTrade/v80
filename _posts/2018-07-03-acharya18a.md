abstract: We develop differentially private methods for estimating various distributional
  properties.Given a sample from a discrete distribution p, some functional f, and
  accuracy and privacy parameters alpha and epsilon, the goal is to estimate f(p)
  up to accuracy alpha, while maintaining epsilon-differential privacy of the sample.We
  prove almost-tight bounds on the sample size required for this problem for several
  functionals of interest, including support size, support coverage, and entropy.We
  show that the cost of privacy is negligible in a variety of settings, both theoretically
  and experimentally.Our methods are based on a sensitivity analysis of several state-of-the-art
  methods for estimating these properties with sublinear sample complexities
