abstract: MAP perturbation models have emerged as a powerful framework for inference
  in structured prediction. Such models provide a way to efficiently sample from the
  Gibbs distribution and facilitate predictions that are robust to random noise. In
  this paper, we propose a provably polynomial time randomized algorithm for learning
  the parameters of perturbed MAP predictors. Our approach is based on minimizing
  a novel Rademacher-based generalization bound on the expected loss of a perturbed
  MAP predictor, which can be computed in polynomial time. We obtain conditions under
  which our randomized learning algorithm can guarantee generalization to unseen examples.
