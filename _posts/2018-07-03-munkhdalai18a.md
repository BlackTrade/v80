abstract: We describe a mechanism by which artificial neural networks can learn rapid
  adaptation - the ability to adapt on the fly, with little data, to new tasks - that
  we call conditionally shifted neurons. We apply this mechanism in the framework
  of metalearning, where the aim is to replicate some of the flexibility of human
  learning in machines. Conditionally shifted neurons modify their activation values
  with task-specific shifts retrieved from a memory module, which is populated rapidly
  based on limited task experience. On metalearning benchmarks from the vision and
  language domains, models augmented with conditionally shifted neurons achieve state-of-the-art
  results.
