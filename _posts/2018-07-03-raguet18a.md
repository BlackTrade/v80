abstract: We present an extension of the cut-pursuit algorithm, introduced by Landrieu
  and Obozinski (2017), to the graph total-variation regularization of functions with
  a separable nondifferentiable part.We propose a modified algorithmic scheme as well
  as adapted proofs of convergence. We also present a heuristic approach for handling
  the cases in which the values associated to each vertex of the graph are multidimensional.The
  performance of our algorithm, which we demonstrate on difficult, ill-conditioned
  large-scale inverse and learning problems, is such that it may in practice extend
  the scope of application of the total-variation regularization.
