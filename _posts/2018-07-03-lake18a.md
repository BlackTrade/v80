abstract: Humans can understand and produce new utterances effortlessly, thanks to
  their compositional skills. Once a person learns the meaning of a new verb "dax,"
  he or she can immediately understand the meaning of "dax twice" or "sing and dax."
  In this paper, we introduce the SCAN domain, consisting of a set of simple compositional
  navigation commands paired with the corresponding action sequences. We then test
  the zero-shot generalization capabilities of a variety of recurrent neural networks
  (RNNs) trained on SCAN with sequence-to-sequence methods. We find that RNNs can
  make successful zero-shot generalizations when the differences between training
  and test commands are small, so that they can apply "mix-and-match" strategies to
  solve the task. However, when generalization requires systematic compositional skills
  (as in the "dax" example above), RNNs fail spectacularly. We conclude with a proof-of-concept
  experiment in neural machine translation, suggesting that lack of systematicity
  might be partially responsible for neural networksâ€™ notorious training data thirst.
