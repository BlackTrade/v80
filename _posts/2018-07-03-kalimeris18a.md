abstract: In this paper we advocate for a hyperparametric approach to learn diffusion
  in the independent cascade (IC) model. The sample complexity of this model is a
  function of the number of edges in the network and consequently learning becomes
  infeasible when the network is large. We study a natural restriction of the hypothesis
  class using additional information available in order to dramatically reduce the
  sample complexity of the learning process. In particular we assume that diffusion
  probabilities can be described as a function of a global hyperparameter and features
  of the individuals in the network. One of the main challenges with this approach
  is that training a model reduces to optimizing a non-convex objective. Despite this
  obstacle, we can shrink the best-known sample complexity bound for learning IC by
  a factor of |E|/d where |E| is the number of edges in the graph and d is the dimension
  of the hyperparameter. We show that under mild assumptions about the distribution
  generating the samples one can provably train a model with low generalization error.
  Finally, we use large-scale diffusion data from Facebook to show that a hyperparametric
  model using approximately 20 features per node achieves remarkably high accuracy.
