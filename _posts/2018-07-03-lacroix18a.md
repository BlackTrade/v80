abstract: The problem of Knowledge Base Completion can be framed as a 3rd-order binary
  tensor completion problem. In this light, the Canonical Tensor Decomposition (CP)
  seems like a natural solution; however, current implementations of CP on standard
  Knowledge Base Completion benchmarks are lagging behind their competitors. In this
  work, we attempt to understand the limits of CP for knowledge base completion. First,
  we motivate and test a novel regularizer, based on tensor nuclear p-norms. Then,
  we present a reformulation of the problem that makes it invariant to arbitrary choices
  in the inclusion of predicates or their reciprocals in the dataset. These two methods
  combined allow us to beat the current state of the art on several datasets with
  a CP decomposition, and obtain even better results using the more advanced ComplEx
  model.
