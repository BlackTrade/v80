abstract: 'The problem of rank aggregation from pairwise and multiway comparisons
  has a wide range of implications, ranging from recommendation systems to sports
  rankings to social choice. Some of the most popular algorithms for this problem
  come from the class of spectral ranking algorithms; these include the rank centrality
  (RC) algorithm for pairwise comparisons, which returns consistent estimates under
  the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons (Negahban et al., 2017),
  and its generalization, the Luce spectral ranking (LSR) algorithm, which returns
  consistent estimates under the more general multinomial logit (MNL) model for multiway
  comparisons (Maystre & Grossglauser, 2015). In this paper, we design a provably
  faster spectral ranking algorithm, which we call accelerated spectral ranking (ASR),
  that is also consistent under the MNL/BTL models. Our accelerated algorithm is achieved
  by designing a random walk that has a faster mixing time than the random walks associated
  with previous algorithms. In addition to a faster algorithm, our results yield improved
  sample complexity bounds for recovery of the MNL/BTL parameters: to the best of
  our knowledge, we give the first general sample complexity bounds for recovering
  the parameters of the MNL model from multiway comparisons under any (connected)
  comparison graph (and improve significantly over previous bounds for the BTL model
  for pairwise comparisons). We also give a message-passing interpretation of our
  algorithm, which suggests a decentralized distributed implementation. Our experiments
  on several real-world and synthetic datasets confirm that our new ASR algorithm
  is indeed orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms.'
