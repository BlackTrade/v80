abstract: Policy gradient methods are a widely used class of model-free reinforcement
  learning algorithms where a state-dependent baseline is used to reduce gradient
  estimator variance. Several recent papers extend the baseline to depend on both
  the state and action and suggest that this significantly reduces variance and improves
  sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates. To better
  understand this development, we decompose the variance of the policy gradient estimator
  and numerically show that learned state-action-dependent baselines do not in fact
  reduce variance over a state-dependent baseline in commonly tested benchmark domains.
  We confirm this unexpected result by reviewing the open-source code accompanying
  these prior papers, and show that subtle implementation decisions cause deviations
  from the methods presented in the papers and explain the source of the previously
  observed empirical gains. Furthermore, the variance decomposition highlights areas
  for improvement, which we demonstrate by illustrating a simple change to the typical
  value function parameterization that can significantly improve performance.
