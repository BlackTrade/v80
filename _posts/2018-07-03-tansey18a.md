abstract: Analyzing large-scale, multi-experiment studies requires scientists to test
  each experimental outcome for statistical significance and then assess the results
  as a whole. We present Black Box FDR (BB-FDR), an empirical-Bayes method for analyzing
  multi-experiment studies when many covariates are gathered per experiment. BB-FDR
  learns a series of black box predictive models to boost power and control the false
  discovery rate (FDR) at two stages of study analysis. In Stage 1, it uses a deep
  neural network prior to report which experiments yielded significant outcomes. In
  Stage 2, a separate black box model of each covariate is used to select features
  that have significant predictive power across all experiments. In benchmarks, BB-FDR
  outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods in both stages of analysis. We apply
  BB-FDR to two real studies on cancer drug efficacy. For both studies, BB-FDR increases
  the proportion of significant outcomes discovered and selects variables that reveal
  key genomic drivers of drug sensitivity and resistance in cancer.
