abstract: We describe two efficient, and exact, algorithms for computing Bellman updates
  in robust Markov decision processes (MDPs). The first algorithm uses a homotopy
  continuation method to compute updates for L1-constrained s,a-rectangular ambiguity
  sets. It runs in quasi-linear time for plain L1-norms and also generalizes to weighted
  L1-norms. The second algorithm uses bisection to compute updates for robust MDPs
  with s-rectangular ambiguity sets. This algorithm, when combined with the homotopy
  method, also has a quasi-linear runtime. Unlike previous methods, our algorithms
  compute the primal solution in addition to the optimal objective value, which makes
  them useful in policy iteration methods. Our experimental results indicate that
  the proposed methods are over 1,000 times faster than Gurobi, a state-of-the-art
  commercial optimization package, for small instances, and the performance gap grows
  considerably with problem size.
