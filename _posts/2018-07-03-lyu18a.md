abstract: Bayesian optimization methods are promising for the optimization of black-box
  functions that are expensive to evaluate. In this paper, a novel batch Bayesian
  optimization approach is proposed. The parallelization is realized via a multi-objective
  ensemble of multiple acquisition functions. In each iteration, the multi-objective
  optimization of the multiple acquisition functions is performed to search for the
  Pareto front of the acquisition functions. The batch of inputs are then selected
  from the Pareto front. The Pareto front represents the best trade-off between the
  multiple acquisition functions. Such a policy for batch Bayesian optimization can
  significantly improve the efficiency of optimization. The proposed method is compared
  with several state-of-the-art batch Bayesian optimization algorithms using analytical
  benchmark functions and real-world analog integrated circuits. The experimental
  results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art
  algorithms.
