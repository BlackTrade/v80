abstract: We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent
  to approximate inference in Bayesian models. We further demonstrate that this finding
  allows us to make meaningful estimates of the model uncertainty using conventional
  architectures, without modifications to the network or the training procedure. Our
  approach is thoroughly validated by measuring the quality of uncertainty in a series
  of empirical experiments on different tasks. It outperforms baselines with strong
  statistical significance, and displays competitive performance with recent Bayesian
  approaches.
