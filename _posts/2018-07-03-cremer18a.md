abstract: 'Amortized inference allows latent-variable models trained via variational
  learning to scale to large datasets. The quality of approximate inference is determined
  by two factors: a) the capacity of the variational distribution to match the true
  posterior and b) the ability of the recognition network to produce good variational
  parameters for each datapoint. We examine approximate inference in variational autoencoders
  in terms of these factors. We find that divergence from the true posterior is often
  due to imperfect recognition networks, rather than the limited complexity of the
  approximating distribution. We show that this is due partly to the generator learning
  to accommodate the choice of approximation. Furthermore, we show that the parameters
  used to increase the expressiveness of the approximation play a role in generalizing
  inference rather than simply improving the complexity of the approximation.'
