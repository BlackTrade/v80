abstract: 'Sparsity is a basic property of real vectorsthat is exploited in a wide
  variety of ma-chine learning applications. In this work, wedescribe property testing
  algorithms for spar-sity that observe a low-dimensional projec-tion of the input.
  We consider two settings.In the first setting, we test sparsity with re-spect to
  an unknown basis: given input vec-tors $y_1 ,...,y_p ∈R^d$ whose concatenation ascolumns
  forms $Y ∈R^d \times p$ , does $Y = AX$for matrices $A ∈R^d\times m$ and $X ∈R^m
  \times p$ suchthat each column of $X$ is $k$-sparse, or is $Y$“far” from having
  such a decomposition? Inthe second setting, we test sparsity with re-spect to a
  known basis: for a fixed design ma-trix $A ∈R^d \times m$ , given input vector $y
  ∈R^d$ ,is $y = Ax$ for some $k$-sparse vector $x$ or is$y$ “far” from having such
  a decomposition?We analyze our algorithms using tools fromhigh-dimensional geometry
  and probability.'
