abstract: 'Sparsity is a basic property of real vectors that is exploited in a wide
  variety of machine learning applications. In this work, we describe property testing
  algorithms for sparsity that observe a low-dimensional projec- tion of the input.
  We consider two settings. In the first setting, we test sparsity with respect to
  an unknown basis: given input vectors $y_1 ,...,y_p \in R^d$ whose concatenation
  as columns forms $Y \in R^{d \times p}$ , does $Y = AX$ for matrices $A \in R^{d\times
  m}$ and $X \in R^{m \times p}$ such that each column of $X$ is $k$-sparse, or is
  $Y$ “far” from having such a decomposition? In the second setting, we test sparsity
  with respect to a known basis: for a fixed design ma- trix $A \in R^{d \times m}$
  , given input vector $y \in R^d$ , is $y = Ax$ for some $k$-sparse vector $x$ or
  is $y$ “far” from having such a decomposition? We analyze our algorithms using tools
  from high-dimensional geometry and probability.'
