abstract: Recent studies have illustrated that stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte
  Carlo techniques have a strong potential in non-convex optimization, where local
  and global convergence guarantees can be shown under certain conditions. By building
  up on this recent theory, in this study, we develop an asynchronous-parallel stochastic
  L-BFGS algorithm for non-convex optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable
  for both distributed and shared-memory settings. We provide formal theoretical analysis
  and show that the proposed method achieves an ergodic convergence rate of ${\cal
  O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ ($N$ being the total number of iterations) and it can achieve a
  linear speedup under certain conditions. We perform several experiments on both
  synthetic and real datasets. The results support our theory and show that the proposed
  algorithm provides a significant speedup over the recently proposed synchronous
  distributed L-BFGS algorithm.
