abstract: In a large-scale and distributed matrix multiplication problem $C=A^{⊺}B$,
  where $C∈\mathbb{R}^{r\times t}$, the coded computation plays an important role
  to effectively deal with “stragglers” (distributed computations that may get delayed
  due to few slow or faulty processors). However, existing coded schemes could destroy
  the significant sparsity that exists in large-scale machine learning problems, and
  could result in much higher computation overhead, i.e., $O(rt)$ decoding time. In
  this paper, we develop a new coded computation strategy, we call <em>sparse code</em>,
  which achieves near <em>optimal recovery threshold</em>, <em>low computation overhead</em>,
  and <em>linear decoding time</em> $O(nnz(C))$. We implement our scheme and demonstrate
  the advantage of the approach over both uncoded and current fastest coded strategies.
