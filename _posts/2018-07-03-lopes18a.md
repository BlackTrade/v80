abstract: Over the course of the past decade, a variety of randomized algorithms have
  been proposed for computing approximate least-squares (LS) solutions in large-scale
  settings. A longstanding practical issue is that, for any given input, the user
  rarely knows the actual error of an approximate solution (relative to the exact
  solution). Likewise, it is difficult for the user to know precisely how much computation
  is needed to achieve the desired error tolerance. Consequently, the user often appeals
  to worst-case error bounds that tend to offer only qualitative guidance. As a more
  practical alternative, we propose a bootstrap method to compute a posteriori error
  estimates for randomized LS algorithms. These estimates permit the user to numerically
  assess the error of a given solution, and to predict how much work is needed to
  improve a "preliminary" solution. In addition, we provide theoretical consistency
  results for the method, which are the first such results in this context (to the
  best of our knowledge). From a practical standpoint, the method also has considerable
  flexibility, insofar as it can be applied to several popular sketching algorithms,
  as well as a variety of error metrics. Moreover, the extra step of error estimation
  does not add much cost to an underlying sketching algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the method with empirical results.
