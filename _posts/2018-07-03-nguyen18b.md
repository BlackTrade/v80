abstract: In the recent literature the important role of depth in deep learning has
  been emphasized. In this paper we argue that sufficient width of a feedforward network
  is equally important by answering the simple question under which conditions the
  decision regions of a neural network are connected. It turns out that for a class
  of activation functions including leaky ReLU, neural networks having a pyramidal
  structure, that is no layer has more hidden units than the input dimension, produce
  necessarily connected decision regions. This implies that a sufficiently wide hidden
  layer is necessary to guarantee that the network can produce disconnected decision
  regions. We discuss the implications of this result for the construction of neural
  networks, in particular the relation to the problem of adversarial manipulation
  of classifiers.
