abstract: 'It is increasingly common in many types of natural and physical systems
  (especially biological systems) to have different types of measurements performed
  on the same underlying system. In such settings, it is important to align the manifolds
  arising from each measurement in order to integrate such data and gain an improved
  picture of the system; we tackle this problem using generative adversarial networks
  (GANs). Recent attempts to use GANs to find correspondences between sets of samples
  do not explicitly perform proper alignment of manifolds. We present the new Manifold
  Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that related points in each
  measurement space are aligned. We demonstrate applications of MAGAN in single-cell
  biology in integrating two different measurement types together: cells from the
  same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing) and proteomic
  (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that MAGAN successfully aligns manifolds
  such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared to other
  recently proposed models.'
