abstract: 'We introduce a conceptually simple and scalable framework for continual
  learning domains where tasks are learned sequentially. Our method is constant in
  the number of parameters and is designed to preserve performance on previously encountered
  tasks while accelerating learning progress on subsequent problems. This is achieved
  by training a network with two components: A knowledge base, capable of solving
  previously encountered problems, which is connected to an active column that is
  employed to efficiently learn the current task. After learning a new task, the active
  column is distilled into the knowledge base, taking care to protect any previously
  acquired skills. This cycle of active learning (progression) followed by consolidation
  (compression) requires no architecture growth, no access to or storing of previous
  data or tasks, and no task-specific parameters. We demonstrate the progress & compress
  approach on sequential classification of handwritten alphabets as well as two reinforcement
  learning domains: Atari games and 3D maze navigation.'
