abstract: Understanding the representational power of Restricted Boltzmann Machines
  (RBMs) with multiple layers is an ill-understood problem and is an area of active
  research. Motivated from the approach of <em>Inherent Structure formalism</em> (Stillinger
  & Weber, 1982), extensively used in analysing Spin Glasses, we propose a novel measure
  called <em>Inherent Structure Capacity</em> (ISC), which characterizes the representation
  capacity of a fixed architecture RBM by the expected number of modes of distributions
  emanating from the RBM with parameters drawn from a prior distribution. Though ISC
  is intractable, we show that for a single layer RBM architecture ISC approaches
  a finite constant as number of hidden units are increased and to further improve
  the ISC, one needs to add a second layer. Furthermore, we introduce <em>Lean</em>
  RBMs, which are multi-layer RBMs where each layer can have at-most O(n) units with
  the number of visible units being n. We show that for every single layer RBM with
  Omega(n^{2+r}), r >= 0, hidden units there exists a two-layered <em>lean</em> RBM
  with Theta(n^2) parameters with the same ISC, establishing that 2 layer RBMs can
  achieve the same representational power as single-layer RBMs but using far fewer
  number of parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which
  quantitatively establishes the need for layering.
