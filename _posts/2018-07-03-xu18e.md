abstract: In supervised learning, we leverage a labeled dataset to design methodsfor
  function estimation.In many practical situations, we are able to obtainalternative
  feedback, possibly at a low cost. A broad goal is to understand the usefulnessof,
  and to design algorithms to exploit, this alternative feedback.We focus on a semi-supervised
  setting where we obtain additional ordinal (or comparison) information for potentially
  unlabeled samples. We considerordinal feedback of varying qualities where we have
  either a perfect ordering of the samples, a noisy ordering of the samples or noisy
  pairwise comparisons between the samples.We provide a precise quantification of
  the usefulness of these types of ordinal feedback in non-parametric regression,
  showing that in many cases it is possible to accurately estimate an underlying function
  with a very small labeled set, effectively escaping the curse of dimensionality.We
  develop an algorithm called Ranking-Regression (RR) and analyze its accuracy as
  a function of size of the labeled and unlabeled datasetsand various noise parameters.We
  also present lower bounds, that establish fundamental limits for the task and show
  that RR is optimal in a variety of settings. Finally, we present experiments that
  show the efficacy of RR and investigate its robustness to various sources of noise
  and model-misspecification.
