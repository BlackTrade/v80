abstract: In this work, we study two first-order primal-dual based algorithms, the
  Gradient Primal-Dual Algorithm (GPDA) and the Gradient Alternating Direction Method
  of Multipliers (GADMM), for solving a class of linearly constrained non-convex optimization
  problems. We show that with random initialization of the primal and dual variables,
  both algorithms are able to compute second-order stationary solutions (ss2) with
  probability one. This is the first result showing that primal-dual algorithm is
  capable of finding ss2 when only using first-order information; it also extends
  the existing results for first-order, but primal-only algorithms. An important implication
  of our result is that it also gives rise to the first global convergence result
  to the ss2, for two classes of unconstrained distributed non-convex learning problems
  over multi-agent networks.
