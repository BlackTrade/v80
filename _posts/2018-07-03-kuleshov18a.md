abstract: Methods for reasoning under uncertainty are a key building block of accurate
  and reliable machine learning systems. Bayesian methods provide a general framework
  to quantify uncertainty. However, because of model misspecification and the use
  of approximate inference, Bayesian uncertainty estimates are often inaccurate {â€”}
  for example, a 90% credible interval may not contain the true outcome 90% of the
  time. Here, we propose a simple procedure for calibrating any regression algorithm;
  when applied to Bayesian and probabilistic models, it is guaranteed to produce calibrated
  uncertainty estimates given enough data. Our procedure is inspired by Platt scaling
  and extends previous work on classification. We evaluate this approach on Bayesian
  linear regression, feedforward, and recurrent neural networks, and find that it
  consistently outputs well-calibrated credible intervals while improving performance
  on time series forecasting and model-based reinforcement learning tasks.
