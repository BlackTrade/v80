abstract: Supervised learning needs a huge amount of labeled data, which can be a
  big bottleneck under the situation where there is a privacy concern or labeling
  cost is high. To overcome this problem, we propose a new weakly-supervised learning
  setting where only similar (S) data pairs (two examples belong to the same class)
  and unlabeled (U) data points are needed instead of fully labeled data, which is
  called SU classification. We show that an unbiased estimator of the classification
  risk can be obtained only from SU data, and the estimation error of its empirical
  risk minimizer achieves the optimal parametric convergence rate. Finally, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments.
