abstract: We consider a team of reinforcement learning agents that concurrently learn
  to operate in a common environment. We identify three properties - adaptivity, commitment,
  and diversity - which are necessary for efficient coordinated exploration and demonstrate
  that straightforward extensions to single-agent optimistic and posterior sampling
  approaches fail to satisfy them. As an alternative, we propose seed sampling, which
  extends posterior sampling in a manner that meets these requirements. Simulation
  results investigate how per-agent regret decreases as the number of agents grows,
  establishing substantial advantages of seed sampling over alternative exploration
  schemes.
