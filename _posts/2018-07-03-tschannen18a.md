abstract: A large fraction of the arithmetic operations required to evaluate deep
  neural networks (DNNs) consists of matrix multiplications, in both convolution and
  fully connected layers. We perform end-to-end learning of low-cost approximations
  of matrix multiplications in DNN layers by casting matrix multiplications as 2-layer
  sum-product networks (SPNs) (arithmetic circuits) and learning their (ternary) edge
  weights from data. The SPNs disentangle multiplication and addition operations and
  enable us to impose a budget on the number of multiplication operations. Combining
  our method with knowledge distillation and applying it to image classification DNNs
  (trained on ImageNet) and language modeling DNNs (using LSTMs), we obtain a first-of-a-kind
  reduction in number of multiplications (over 99.5%) while maintaining the predictive
  performance of the full-precision models. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed
  framework is able to rediscover Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication algorithm, learning
  to multiply $2 \times 2$ matrices using only 7 multiplications instead of 8.
