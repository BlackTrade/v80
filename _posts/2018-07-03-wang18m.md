abstract: We study the parameter tuning problem for the penalized regression model.
  Finding the optimal choice of the regularization parameter is a challenging problem
  in high-dimensional regimes where both the number of observations n and the number
  of parameters p are large. We propose two frameworks to obtain a computationally
  efficient approximation ALO of the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) risk for
  nonsmooth losses and regularizers. Our two frameworks are based on the primal and
  dual formulations of the penalized regression model. We prove the equivalence of
  the two approaches under smoothness conditions. This equivalence enables us to justify
  the accuracy of both methods under such conditions. We use our approaches to obtain
  a risk estimate for several standard problems, including generalized LASSO, nuclear
  norm regularization and support vector machines. We experimentally demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our results for non-differentiable cases.
