abstract: In this paper, we make an important step towards the black-box machine teaching
  by considering the cross-space machine teaching, where the teacher and the learner
  use different feature representations and the teacher can not fully observe the
  learner’s model. In such scenario, we study how the teacher is still able to teach
  the learner to achieve faster convergence rate than the traditional passive learning.
  We propose an active teacher model that can actively query the learner (i.e., make
  the learner take exams) for estimating the learner’s status and provably guide the
  learner to achieve faster convergence. The sample complexities for both teaching
  and query are provided. In the experiments, we compare the proposed active teacher
  with the omniscient teacher and verify the effectiveness of the active teacher model.
