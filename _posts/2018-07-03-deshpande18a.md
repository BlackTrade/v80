abstract: 'Estimators computed from adaptively collected data do not behave like their
  non-adaptive brethren.Rather, the sequential dependence of the collection policy
  can lead to severe distributional biases that persist even in the infinite data
  limit.We develop a general method – <em>$\mathbf{W}$-decorrelation</em> – for transforming
  the bias of adaptive linear regression estimators into variance.The method uses
  only coarse-grained information about the data collection policy and does not need
  access to propensity scores or exact knowledge of the policy.We bound the finite-sample
  bias and variance of the $\mathbf{W}$-estimator and develop asymptotically correct
  confidence intervals based on a novel martingale central limit theorem. We then
  demonstrate the empirical benefits of the generic $\mathbf{W}$-decorrelation procedure
  in two different adaptive data settings: the multi-armed bandit and the autoregressive
  time series.'
