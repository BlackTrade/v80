abstract: Most works on adversarial examples for deep-learning based image classifiers
  usenoise that, while small, covers the entire image. We explore the case where thenoise
  is allowed to be visible but confined to a small, localized patch of theimage, without
  covering any of the main object(s) in the image. We show that it is possible to
  generate localized adversarial noises that cover only 2% of the pixels in the image,
  none of them over the main object, and that are transferable acrossimages and locations,
  and successfully fool a state-of-the-art Inception v3model with very high success
  rates.
