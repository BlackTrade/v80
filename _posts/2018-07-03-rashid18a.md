abstract: In many real-world settings, a team of agents must coordinate their behaviour
  while acting in a decentralised way. At the same time, it is often possible to train
  the agents in a centralised fashion in a simulated or laboratory setting, where
  global state information is available and communication constraints are lifted.
  Learning joint action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive
  way to exploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting decentralised
  policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based method that can train
  decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a network
  that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent
  values that condition only on local observations. We structurally enforce that the
  joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable
  maximisation of the joint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency
  between the centralised and decentralised policies. We evaluate QMIX on a challenging
  set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and show that QMIX significantly outperforms
  existing value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.
