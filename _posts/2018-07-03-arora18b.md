abstract: Deep nets generalize well despite having more parameters than the number
  of training samples. Recent works try to give an explanation using PAC-Bayes and
  Margin-based analyses, but do not as yet result in sample complexity bounds better
  than naive parameter counting. The current paper shows generalization bounds that
  are orders of magnitude better in practice. These rely upon new succinct reparametrizations
  of the trained net â€” a compression that is explicit and efficient. These yield generalization
  bounds via a simple compression-based framework introduced here. Our results also
  provide some theoretical justification for widespread empirical success in compressing
  deep nets. Analysis of correctness of our compression relies upon some newly identified
  noise stability properties of trained deep nets, which are also experimentally verified.
  The study of these properties and resulting generalization bounds are also extended
  to convolutional nets, which had eluded earlier attempts on proving generalization.
