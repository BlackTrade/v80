abstract: Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is a popular method used
  to design distributed versions of a machine learning algorithm, whereby local computations
  are performed on local data with the output exchanged among neighbors in an iterative
  fashion. During this iterative process the leakage of data privacy arises. A differentially
  private ADMM was proposed in prior work (Zhang & Zhu, 2017) where only the privacy
  loss of a single node during one iteration was bounded, a method that makes it difficult
  to balance the tradeoff between the utility attained through distributed computation
  and privacy guarantees when considering the total privacy loss of all nodes over
  the entire iterative process. We propose a perturbation method for ADMM where the
  perturbed term is correlated with the penalty parameters; this is shown to improve
  the utility and privacy simultaneously. The method is based on a modified ADMM where
  each node independently determines its own penalty parameter in every iteration
  and decouples it from the dual updating step size. The condition for convergence
  of the modified ADMM and the lower bound on the convergence rate are also derived.
