abstract: Faced with distribution shift between training and test set, we wish to
  detect and quantify the shift, and to correct our classifiers without test set labels.
  Motivated by medical diagnosis, where diseases (targets), cause symptoms (observations),
  we focus on label shift, where the label marginal p(y) changes but the conditional
  p(x| y) does not. We propose Black Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) to estimate the test
  distribution p(y). BBSE exploits arbitrary black box predictors to reduce dimensionality
  prior to shift correction. While better predictors give tighter estimates, BBSE
  works even when predictors are biased, inaccurate, or uncalibrated, so long as their
  confusion matrices are invertible. We prove BBSEâ€™s consistency, bound its error,
  and introduce a statistical test that uses BBSE to detect shift. We also leverage
  BBSE to correct classifiers. Experiments demonstrate accurate estimates and improved
  prediction, even on high-dimensional datasets of natural images.
