abstract: The Gaussian mechanism is an essential building block used in multitude
  of differentially private data analysis algorithms. In this paper we revisit the
  Gaussian mechanism and show that the original analysis has several important limitations.
  Our analysis reveals that the variance formula for the original mechanism is far
  from tight in the high privacy regime ($\varepsilon \to 0$) and it cannot be extended
  to the low privacy regime ($\varepsilon \to \infty$). We address these limitations
  by developing an optimal Gaussian mechanism whose variance is calibrated directly
  using the Gaussian cumulative density function instead of a tail bound approximation.
  We also propose to equip the Gaussian mechanism with a post-processing step based
  on adaptive estimation techniques by leveraging that the distribution of the perturbation
  is known. Our experiments show that analytical calibration removes at least a third
  of the variance of the noise compared to the classical Gaussian mechanism, and that
  denoising dramatically improves the accuracy of the Gaussian mechanism in the high-dimensional
  regime.
