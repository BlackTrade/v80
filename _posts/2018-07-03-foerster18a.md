abstract: The score function estimator is widely used for estimating gradients of
  stochastic objectives in stochastic computation graphs (SCG), eg., in reinforcement
  learning and meta-learning. While deriving the first-order gradient estimators by
  differentiating a surrogate loss (SL) objective is computationally and conceptually
  simple, using the same approach for higher-order derivatives is more challenging.
  Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing such estimators is laborious and
  not compliant with automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL to
  construct new objectives for each order derivative involves increasingly cumbersome
  graph manipulations. Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under differentiation,
  SL treats part of the cost as a fixed sample, which we show leads to missing and
  wrong terms for estimators of higher-order derivatives. To address all these shortcomings
  in a unified way, we introduce DiCE, which provides a single objective that can
  be differentiated repeatedly, generating correct estimators of derivatives of any
  order in SCGs. Unlike SL, DiCE relies on automatic differentiation for performing
  the requisite graph manipulations. We verify the correctness of DiCE both through
  a proof and numerical evaluation of the DiCE derivative estimates. We also use DiCE
  to propose and evaluate a novel approach for multi-agent learning. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/alshedivat/lola.
