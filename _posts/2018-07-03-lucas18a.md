abstract: 'Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pow- erful generative models
  based on providing feed- back to a generative network via a discriminator network.
  However, the discriminator usually as- sesses individual samples. This prevents
  the dis- criminator from accessing global distributional statistics of generated
  samples, and often leads to mode dropping: the generator models only part of the
  target distribution. We propose to feed the discriminator with mixed batches of
  true and fake samples, and train it to predict the ratio of true samples in the
  batch. The latter score does not depend on the order of samples in a batch. Rather
  than learning this invariance, we introduce a generic permutation-invariant discriminator
  ar- chitecture. This architecture is provably a uni- versal approximator of all
  symmetric functions. Experimentally, our approach reduces mode col- lapse in GANs
  on two synthetic datasets, and obtains good results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets,
  both qualitatively and quantitatively.'
