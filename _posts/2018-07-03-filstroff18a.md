abstract: We present novel understandings of the Gamma-Poisson (GaP) model, a probabilistic
  matrix factorization model for count data. We show that GaP can be rewritten free
  of the score/activation matrix. This gives us new insights about the estimation
  of the topic/dictionary matrix by maximum marginal likelihood estimation. In particular,
  this explains the robustness of this estimator to over-specified values of the factorization
  rank, especially its ability to automatically prune irrelevant dictionary columns,
  as empirically observed in previous work. The marginalization of the activation
  matrix leads in turn to a new Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm with
  favorable properties.
