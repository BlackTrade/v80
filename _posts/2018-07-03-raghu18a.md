abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many recent successes, but our
  understanding of its strengths and limitations is hampered by the lack of rich environments
  in which we can fully characterize optimal behavior, and correspondingly diagnose
  individual actions against such a characterization. Here we consider a family of
  combinatorial games, arising from work of Erdos, Selfridge, and Spencer, and we
  propose their use as environments for evaluating and comparing different approaches
  to reinforcement learning. These games have a number of appealing features: they
  are challenging for current learning approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional,
  simply parametrized environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution
  for optimal behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be
  tuned by changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer
  games not only to compare different algorithms, but test for generalization, make
  comparisons to supervised learning, analyse multiagent play, and even develop a
  self play algorithm.'
