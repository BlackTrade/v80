abstract: Many artificial intelligence tasks appear in dual forms like English$↔$French
  translation and speech$↔$text transformation. Existing dual learning schemes, which
  are proposed to solve a pair of such dual tasks, explore how to leverage such dualities
  from data level. In this work, we propose a new learning framework, model-level
  dual learning, which takes duality of tasks into consideration while designing the
  architectures for the primal/dual models, and ties the model parameters that playing
  similar roles in the two tasks. We study both symmetric and asymmetric model-level
  dual learning. Our algorithms achieve significant improvements on neural machine
  translation and sentiment analysis.
