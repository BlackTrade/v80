abstract: Softmax is the most commonly used output function for multiclass problems
  and is widely used in areas such as vision, natural language processing, and recommendation.
  A softmax model has linear costs in the number of classes which makes it too expensive
  for many real-world problems. A common approach to speed up training involves sampling
  only some of the classes at each training step. It is known that this method is
  biased and that the bias increases the more the sampling distribution deviates from
  the output distribution. Nevertheless, almost all recent work uses simple sampling
  distributions that require a large sample size to mitigate the bias. In this work,
  we propose a new class of kernel based sampling methods and develop an efficient
  sampling algorithm. Kernel based sampling adapts to the model as it is trained,
  thus resulting in low bias. It can also be easily applied to many models because
  it relies only on the modelâ€™s last hidden layer. We empirically study the trade-off
  of bias, sampling distribution and sample size and show that kernel based sampling
  results in low bias with few samples.
