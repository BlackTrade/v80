abstract: A major challenge in Bayesian Optimization is the boundary issue where an
  algorithm spends too many evaluations near the boundary of its search space. In
  this paper, we propose BOCK, Bayesian Optimization with Cylindrical Kernels, whose
  basic idea is to transform the ball geometry of the search space using a cylindrical
  transformation. Because of the transformed geometry, the Gaussian Process-based
  surrogate model spends less budget searching near the boundary, while concentrating
  its efforts relatively more near the center of the search region, where we expect
  the solution to be located. We evaluate BOCK extensively, showing that it is not
  only more accurate and efficient, but it also scales successfully to problems with
  a dimensionality as high as 500. We show that the better accuracy and scalability
  of BOCK even allows optimizing modestly sized neural network layers, as well as
  neural network hyperparameters.
