abstract: One of the biggest challenges in the research of generative adversarial
  networks (GANs) is assessing the quality of generated samples and detecting various
  levels of mode collapse. In this work, we construct a novel measure of performance
  of a GAN by comparing geometrical properties of the underlying data manifold and
  the generated one, which provides both qualitative and quantitative means for evaluation.
  Our algorithm can be applied to datasets of an arbitrary nature and is not limited
  to visual data. We test the obtained metric on various real-life models and datasets
  and demonstrate that our method provides new insights into properties of GANs.
