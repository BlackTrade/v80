abstract: While itâ€™s always possible to compute a variational approximation to a posterior
  distribution, it can be difficult to discover problems with this approximation".
  We propose two diagnostic algorithms to alleviate this problem. The Pareto-smoothed
  importance sampling (PSIS) diagnostic gives a goodness of fit measurement for joint
  distributions, while simultaneously improving the error in the estimate. The variational
  simulation-based calibration (VSBC) assesses the average performance of point estimates.
