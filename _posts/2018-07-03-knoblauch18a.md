abstract: Bayesian On-line Changepoint Detection is extended to on-line model selection
  and non-stationary spatio-temporal processes. We propose spatially structured Vector
  Autoregressions (VARs) for modelling the process between changepoints (CPs) and
  give an upper bound on the approximation error of such models. The resulting algorithm
  performs prediction, model selection and CP detection on-line. Its time complexity
  is linear and its space complexity constant, and thus it is two orders of magnitudes
  faster than its closest competitor. In addition, it outperforms the state of the
  art for multivariate data.
