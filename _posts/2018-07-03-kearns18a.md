abstract: The most prevalent notions of fairness in machine learning fix a small collection
  of pre-defined groups (such as race or gender), and then ask for approximate parity
  of some statistic of the classifier (such as false positive rate) across these groups.
  Constraints of this form are susceptible to fairness gerrymandering, in which a
  classifier is fair on each individual group, but badly violates the fairness constraint
  on structured subgroups, such as certain combinations of protected attribute values.
  We thus consider fairness across exponentially or infinitely many subgroups, defined
  by a structured class of functions over the protected attributes. We first prove
  that the problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false positive
  rates and statistical parity is computationally equivalent to the problem of weak
  agnostic learning â€” which means it is hard in the worst case, even for simple structured
  subclasses. However, it also suggests that common heuristics for learning can be
  applied to successfully solve the auditing problem in practice.We then derive an
  algorithm that provably converges in a polynomial number of steps to the best subgroup-fair
  distribution over classifiers, given access to an oracle which can solve the agnostic
  learning problem. The algorithm is based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as
  a zero-sum game between a Learner (the primal player) and an Auditor (the dual player).
  We implement a variant of this algorithm using heuristic oracles, and show that
  we can effectively both audit and learn fair classifiers on a real dataset.
