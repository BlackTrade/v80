abstract: We propose new positive definite kernels for permutations. First we introduce
  a weighted version of the Kendall kernel, which allows to weight unequally the contributions
  of different item pairs in the permutations depending on their ranks. Like the Kendall
  kernel, we show that the weighted version is invariant to relabeling of items and
  can be computed efficiently in O(n ln(n)) operations, where n is the number of items
  in the permutation. Second, we propose a supervised approach to learn the weights
  by jointly optimizing them with the function estimated by a kernel machine. Third,
  while the Kendall kernel considers pairwise comparison between items, we extend
  it by considering higher-order comparisons among tuples of items and show that the
  supervised approach of learning the weights can be systematically generalized to
  higher-order permutation kernels.
