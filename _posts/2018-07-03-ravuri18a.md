abstract: 'We propose a method of moments (MoM) algorithm for training large-scale
  implicit generative models. Moment estimation in this setting encounters two problems:
  it is often difficult to define the millions of moments needed to learn the model
  parameters, and it is hard to determine which properties are useful when specifying
  moments. To address the first issue, we introduce a moment network, and define the
  moments as the network’s hidden units and the gradient of the network’s output with
  respect to its parameters. To tackle the second problem, we use asymptotic theory
  to highlight desiderata for moments – namely they should minimize the asymptotic
  variance of estimated model parameters – and introduce an objective to learn better
  moments. The sequence of objectives created by this Method of Learned Moments (MoLM)
  can train high-quality neural image samplers. On CIFAR-10, we demonstrate that MoLM-trained
  generators achieve significantly higher Inception Scores and lower Frechet Inception
  Distances than those trained with gradient penalty-regularized and spectrally-normalized
  adversarial objectives. These generators also achieve nearly perfect Multi-Scale
  Structural Similarity Scores on CelebA, and can create high-quality samples of 128x128
  images.'
