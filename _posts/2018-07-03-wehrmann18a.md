abstract: One of the most challenging machine learning problems is a particular case
  of data classification in which classes are hierarchically structured and objects
  can be assigned to multiple paths of the class hierarchy at the same time. This
  task is known as hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC), with applications
  in text classification, image annotation, and in bioinformatics problems such as
  protein function prediction. In this paper, we propose novel neural network architectures
  for HMC called HMCN, capable of simultaneously optimizing local and global loss
  functions for discovering local hierarchical class-relationships and global information
  from the entire class hierarchy while penalizing hierarchical violations. We evaluate
  its performance in 21 datasets from four distinct domains, and we compare it against
  the current HMC state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that HMCN substantially
  outperforms all baselines with statistical significance, arising as the novel state-of-the-art
  for HMC.
