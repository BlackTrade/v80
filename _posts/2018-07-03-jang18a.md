abstract: 'Video prediction aims to generate realistic future frames by learning dynamic
  visual patterns. One fundamental challenge is to deal with future uncertainty: How
  should a model behave when there are multiple correct, equally probable future?
  We propose an Appearance-Motion Conditional GAN to address this challenge. We provide
  appearance and motion information as conditions that specify how the future may
  look like, reducing the level of uncertainty. Our model consists of a generator,
  two discriminators taking charge of appearance and motion pathways, and a perceptual
  ranking module that encourages videos of similar conditions to look similar. To
  train our model, we develop a novel conditioning scheme that consists of different
  combinations of appearance and motion conditions. We evaluate our model using facial
  expression and human action datasets and report favorable results compared to existing
  methods.'
