abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data
  but suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients. Recent work on Unitary Recurrent
  Neural Networks (uRNNs) have been used to address this issue and in some cases,
  exceed the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). We propose a
  simpler and novel update scheme to maintain orthogonal recurrent weight matrices
  without using complex valued matrices. This is done by parametrizing with a skew-symmetric
  matrix using the Cayley transform; such a parametrization is unable to represent
  matrices with negative one eigenvalues, but this limitation is overcome by scaling
  the recurrent weight matrix by a diagonal matrix consisting of ones and negative
  ones. The proposed training scheme involves a straightforward gradient calculation
  and update step. In several experiments, the proposed scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent
  neural network (scoRNN) achieves superior results with fewer trainable parameters
  than other unitary RNNs.
