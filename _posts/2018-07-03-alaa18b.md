abstract: 'Clinical prognostic models derived from largescale healthcare data can
  inform critical diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. To enable off-theshelf usage
  of machine learning (ML) in prognostic research, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS: a system
  for automating the design of predictive modeling pipelines tailored for clinical
  prognosis. AUTOPROGNOSIS optimizes ensembles of pipeline configurations efficiently
  using a novel batched Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm that learns a low-dimensional
  decomposition of the pipelines’ high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence
  with the BO procedure. This is achieved by modeling the pipelines’ performances
  as a black-box function with a Gaussian process prior, and modeling the “similarities”
  between the pipelines’ baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet
  prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from “similar” patient
  cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the empirical Bayes
  method. The system automatically explains its predictions by presenting the clinicians
  with logical association rules that link patients’ features to predicted risk strata.
  We demonstrate the utility of AUTOPROGNOSIS using 10 major patient cohorts representing
  various aspects of cardiovascular patient care.'
