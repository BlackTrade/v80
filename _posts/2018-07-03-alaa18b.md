abstract: Clinical prognostic models derived from largescalehealthcare data can inform
  critical diagnosticand therapeutic decisions. To enable off-theshelfusage of machine
  learning (ML) in prognosticresearch, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS:a system for automating
  the design of predictivemodeling pipelines tailored for clinical prognosis.AUTOPROGNOSIS
  optimizes ensembles ofpipeline configurations efficiently using a novelbatched Bayesian
  optimization (BO) algorithmthat learns a low-dimensional decomposition ofthe pipelines’
  high-dimensional hyperparameterspace in concurrence with the BO procedure.This is
  achieved by modeling the pipelines’ performancesas a black-box function with a Gaussianprocess
  prior, and modeling the “similarities”between the pipelines’ baseline algorithmsvia
  a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet prior.Meta-learning is used to warmstart
  BO with externaldata from “similar” patient cohorts by calibratingthe priors using
  an algorithm that mimicsthe empirical Bayes method. The system automaticallyexplains
  its predictions by presentingthe clinicians with logical association rules thatlink
  patients’ features to predicted risk strata. Wedemonstrate the utility of AUTOPROGNOSIS
  using10 major patient cohorts representing various aspectsof cardiovascular patient
  care.
