abstract: The current trend of pushing CNNs deeper with convolutions has created a
  pressing demand to achieve higher compression gains on CNNs where convolutions dominate
  the computation and parameter amount (e.g., GoogLeNet, ResNet and Wide ResNet).
  Further, the high energy consumption of convolutions limits its deployment on mobile
  devices. To this end, we proposed a simple yet effective scheme for compressing
  convolutions though applying k-means clustering on the weights, compression is achieved
  through weight-sharing, by only recording $K$ cluster centers and weight assignment
  indexes. We then introduced a novel spectrally relaxed $k$-means regularization,
  which tends to make hard assignments of convolutional layer weights to $K$ learned
  cluster centers during re-training. We additionally propose an improved set of metrics
  to estimate energy consumption of CNN hardware implementations, whose estimation
  results are verified to be consistent with previously proposed energy estimation
  tool extrapolated from actual hardware measurements. We finally evaluated Deep $k$-Means
  across several CNN models in terms of both compression ratio and energy consumption
  reduction, observing promising results without incurring accuracy loss. The code
