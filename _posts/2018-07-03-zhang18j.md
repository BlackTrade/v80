abstract: Time-series data often exhibit irregular behavior, making them hard to analyze
  and explain with a simple dynamic model. For example, information in social networks
  may show change-point-like bursts that then diffuse with smooth dynamics. Powerful
  models such as deep neural networks learn smooth functions from data, but are not
  as well-suited (in off-the-shelf form) for discovering and explaining sparse, discrete
  and bursty dynamic patterns. Bayesian models can do this well by encoding the appropriate
  probabilistic assumptions in the model prior. We propose an integration of Bayesian
  nonparametric methods within deep neural networks for modeling irregular patterns
  in time-series data. We use a Bayesian nonparametrics to model change-point behavior
  in time, and a deep neural network to model nonlinear latent space dynamics. We
  compare with a non-deep linear version of the model also proposed here. Empirical
  evaluations demonstrates improved performance and interpretable results when tracking
  stock prices and Twitter trends.
