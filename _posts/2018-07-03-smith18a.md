abstract: In the pursuit of increasingly intelligent learning systems, abstraction
  plays a vital role in enabling sophisticated decisions to be made in complex environments.
  The options framework provides formalism for such abstraction over sequences of
  decisions. However most models require that options be given a priori, presumably
  specified by hand, which is neither efficient, nor scalable. Indeed, it is preferable
  to learn options directly from interaction with the environment. Despite several
  efforts, this remains a difficult problem. In this work we develop a novel policy
  gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options. This algorithm
  uses inference methods to simultaneously improve all of the options available to
  an agent, and thus can be employed in an off-policy manner, without observing option
  labels. The differentiable inference procedure employed yields options that can
  be easily interpreted. Empirical results confirm these attributes, and indicate
  that our algorithm has an improved sample efficiency relative to state-of-the-art
  in learning options end-to-end.
