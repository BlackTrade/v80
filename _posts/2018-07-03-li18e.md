abstract: We introduce submodular hypergraphs, a family of hypergraphs that have different
  submodular weights associated with different cuts of hyperedges. Submodular hypergraphs
  arise in cluster- ing applications in which higher-order structures carry relevant
  information. For such hypergraphs, we define the notion of p-Laplacians and derive
  corresponding nodal domain theorems and k-way Cheeger inequalities. We conclude
  with the description of algorithms for computing the spectra of 1- and 2-Laplacians
  that constitute the basis of new spectral hypergraph clustering methods.
