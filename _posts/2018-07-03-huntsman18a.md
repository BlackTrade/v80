abstract: We introduce topological mixture estimation, a completely nonparametric
  and computationally efficient solution to the problem of estimating a one-dimensional
  mixture with generic unimodal components. We repeatedly perturb the unimodal decomposition
  of Baryshnikov and Ghrist to produce a topologically and information-theoretically
  optimal unimodal mixture. We also detail a smoothing process that optimally exploits
  topological persistence of the unimodal category in a natural way when working directly
  with sample data. Finally, we illustrate these techniques through examples.
