abstract: In many real-world problems, there is the possibility to configure, to a
  limited extent, some environmental parameters to improve the performance of a learning
  agent. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Configurable Markov Decision
  Processes (Conf-MDPs), to model this new type of interaction with the environment.
  Furthermore, we provide a new learning algorithm, Safe Policy-Model Iteration (SPMI),
  to jointly and adaptively optimize the policy and the environment configuration.
  After having introduced our approach and derived some theoretical results, we present
  the experimental evaluation in two explicative problems to show the benefits of
  the environment configurability on the performance of the learned policy.
