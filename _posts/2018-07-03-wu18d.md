abstract: Large-scale distributed optimization is of great importance in various applications.
  For data-parallel based distributed learning, the inter-node gradient communication
  often becomes the performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose the error compensated
  quantized stochastic gradient descent algorithm to improve the training efficiency.
  Local gradients are quantized to reduce the communication overhead, and accumulated
  quantization error is utilized to speed up the convergence. Furthermore, we present
  theoretical analysis on the convergence behaviour, and demonstrate its advantage
  over competitors. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm can compress
  gradients by a factor of up to two magnitudes without performance degradation.
