abstract: Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive
  outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts
  but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm)
  algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically
  tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for
  both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets,
  GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared
  to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing
  techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid
  search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\alpha$.
  Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute
  for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective
  of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation
  affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may
  be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.
