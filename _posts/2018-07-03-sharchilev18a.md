abstract: We address the problem of finding influential training samples for a particular
  case of tree ensemble-based models, e.g., Random Forest (RF) or Gradient Boosted
  Decision Trees (GBDT). A natural way of formalizing this problem is studying how
  the modelâ€™s predictions change upon leave-one-out retraining, leaving out each individual
  training sample. Recent work has shown that, for parametric models, this analysis
  can be conducted in a computationally efficient way. We propose several ways of
  extending this framework to non-parametric GBDT ensembles under the assumption that
  tree structures remain fixed. Furthermore, we introduce a general scheme of obtaining
  further approximations to our method that balance the trade-off between performance
  and computational complexity. We evaluate our approaches on various experimental
  setups and use-case scenarios and demonstrate both the quality of our approach to
  finding influential training samples in comparison to the baselines and its computational
  efficiency.
