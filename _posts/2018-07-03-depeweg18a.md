abstract: 'Bayesian neural networks with latent variables are scalable and flexible
  probabilistic models: they account for uncertainty in the estimation of the network
  weights and, by making use of latent variables, can capture complex noise patterns
  in the data. Using these models we show how to perform and utilize a decomposition
  of uncertainty in aleatoric and epistemic components for decision making purposes.
  This allows us to successfully identify informative points for active learning of
  functions with heteroscedastic and bimodal noise. Using the decomposition we further
  define a novel risk-sensitive criterion for reinforcement learningto identify policies
  that balance expected cost, model-bias and noise aversion.'
