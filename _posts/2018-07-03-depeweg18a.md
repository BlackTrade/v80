abstract: 'Bayesian neural networks with latent variables arescalable and flexible
  probabilistic models: theyaccount for uncertainty in the estimation of thenetwork
  weights and, by making use of latent variables,can capture complex noise patterns
  in thedata. Using these models we show how to performand utilize a decomposition
  of uncertainty inaleatoric and epistemic components for decisionmaking purposes.
  This allows us to successfullyidentify informative points for active learning offunctions
  with heteroscedastic and bimodal noise.Using the decomposition we further define
  a novelrisk-sensitive criterion for reinforcement learningto identify policies that
  balance expected cost,model-bias and noise aversion.'
