abstract: 'Despite the recent successes of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs)
  in AI applications, PPLs offer only limited support for random variables whose distributions
  combine discrete and continuous elements. We develop the notion of measure-theoretic
  Bayesian networks (MTBNs) and use it to provide more general semantics for PPLs
  with arbitrarily many random variables defined over arbitrary measure spaces. We
  develop two new general sampling algorithms that are provably correct under the
  MTBN framework: the lexicographic likelihood weighting (LLW) for general MTBNs and
  the lexicographic particle filter (LPF), a specialized algorithm for state-space
  models. We further integrate MTBNs into a widely used PPL system, BLOG, and verify
  the effectiveness of the new inference algorithms through representative examples.'
