abstract: We analyze two novel randomized variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) or conditional
  gradient algorithm.While classical FW algorithms require solving a linear minimization
  problem over the domain at each iteration, the proposed method only requires to
  solve a linear minimization problem over a small <em>subset</em> of the original
  domain.The first algorithm that we propose is a randomized variant of the original
  FW algorithm and achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sublinear convergence rate as in
  the deterministic counterpart. The second algorithm is a randomized variant of the
  Away-step FW algorithm, and again as its deterministic counterpart, reaches linear
  (i.e., exponential) convergence rate making it the first provably convergent randomized
  variant of Away-step FW. In both cases, while subsampling reduces the convergence
  rate by a constant factor, the linear minimization step can be a fraction of the
  cost of that of the deterministic versions, especially when the data is streamed.
  We illustrate computational gains of both algorithms on regression problems, involving
  both $\ell_1$ and latent group lasso penalties.
