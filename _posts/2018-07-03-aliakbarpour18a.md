abstract: We study the fundamental problems of identity and equivalence testing over
  a discrete population from random samples. Our goal is to develop efficient testers
  while guaranteeing differential privacy to the individuals of the population. We
  provide sample-efficient differentially private testers for these problems. Our
  theoretical results significantly improve over the best known algorithms for identity
  testing, and are the first results for private equivalence testing. The conceptual
  message of our work is that there exist private hypothesis testers that are nearly
  as sample-efficient as their non-private counterparts. We perform an experimental
  evaluation of our algorithms on synthetic data. Our experiments illustrate that
  our private testers achieve small type I and type II errors with sample size <em>sublinear</em>
  in the domain size of the underlying distributions.
