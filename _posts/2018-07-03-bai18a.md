abstract: We analyze the performance of the greedy algorithm, and also a discrete
  semi-gradient based algorithm, for maximizing the sum of a suBmodular and suPermodular
  (BP) function (both of which are non-negative monotone non-decreasing) under two
  types of constraints, either a cardinality constraint or $pâ‰¥1$ matroid independence
  constraints. These problems occur naturally in several real-world applications in
  data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The problems are ordinarily
  inapproximable to any factor. Using the curvature $\curv_f$ of the submodular term,
  and introducing $\curv^g$ for the supermodular term (a natural dual curvature for
  supermodular functions), however, both of which are computable in linear time, we
  show that BP maximization can be efficiently approximated by both the greedy and
  the semi-gradient based algorithm. The algorithms yield multiplicative guarantees
  of $\frac{1}{\curv_f}\left[1-e^{-(1-\curv^g)\curv_f}\right]$ and $\frac{1-\curv^g}{(1-\curv^g)\curv_f
  + p}$ for the two types of constraints respectively. For pure monotone supermodular
  constrained maximization, these yield $1-\curvg$ and $(1-\curvg)/p$ for the two
  types of constraints respectively. We also analyze the hardness of BP maximization
  and show that our guarantees match hardness by a constant factor and by $O(\ln(p))$
  respectively. Computational experiments are also provided supporting our analysis.
