abstract: 'In the machine learning research community, it is generally believed that
  there is a tension between memorization and generalization. In this work we examine
  to what extent this tension exists by exploring if it is possible to generalize
  by memorizing alone. Although direct memorization with a lookup table obviously
  does not generalize, we find that introducing depth in the form of a network of
  support-limited lookup tables leads to generalization that is significantly above
  chance and closer to those obtained by standard learning algorithms on several tasks
  derived from MNIST and CIFAR-10. Furthermore, we demonstrate through a series of
  empirical results that our approach allows for a smooth tradeoff between memorization
  and generalization and exhibits some of the most salient characteristics of neural
  networks: depth improves performance; random data can be memorized and yet there
  is generalization on real data; and memorizing random data is harder in a certain
  sense than memorizing real data. The extreme simplicity of the algorithm and potential
  connections with generalization theory point to several interesting directions for
  future research.'
