abstract: Parameter inference for stochastic differential equations is challenging
  due to the presence of a latent diffusion process. Working with an Euler-Maruyama
  discretisation for the diffusion, we use variational inference to jointly learn
  the parameters and the diffusion paths. We use a standard mean-field variational
  approximation of the parameter posterior, and introduce a recurrent neural network
  to approximate the posterior for the diffusion paths conditional on the parameters.
  This neural network learns how to provide Gaussian state transitions which bridge
  between observations in a very similar way to the conditioned diffusion process.
  The resulting black-box inference method can be applied to any SDE system with light
  tuning requirements. We illustrate the method on a Lotka-Volterra system and an
  epidemic model, producing accurate parameter estimates in a few hours.
