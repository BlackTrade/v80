abstract: Stochastic variance reduction algorithms have recently become popular for
  minimizing the average of a large, but finite number of loss functions on a Riemannian
  manifold. The present paper proposes a Riemannian stochastic recursive gradient
  algorithm (R-SRG), which does not require the inverse of retraction between two
  distant iterates on the manifold. Convergence analyses of R-SRG are performed on
  both retraction-convex and non-convex functions under computationally efficient
  retraction and vector transport operations. The key challenge is analysis of the
  influence of vector transport along the retraction curve. Numerical evaluations
  reveal that R-SRG competes well with state-of-the-art Riemannian batch and stochastic
  gradient algorithms.
