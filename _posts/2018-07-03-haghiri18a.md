abstract: Assume we are given a set of items from a general metric space, but we neither
  have access to the representation of the data nor to the distances between data
  points. Instead, suppose that we can actively choose a triplet of items (A, B, C)
  and ask an oracle whether item A is closer to item B or to item C. In this paper,
  we propose a novel random forest algorithm for regression and classification that
  relies only on such triplet comparisons. In the theory part of this paper, we establish
  sufficient conditions for the consistency of such a forest. In a set of comprehensive
  experiments, we then demonstrate that the proposed random forest is efficient both
  for classification and regression. In particular, it is even competitive with other
  methods that have direct access to the metric representation of the data.
