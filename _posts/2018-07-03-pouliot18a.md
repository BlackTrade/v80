abstract: The multicategory SVM (MSVM) of Lee et al. (2004) is a natural generalization
  of the classical, binary support vector machines (SVM). However, its use has been
  limited by computational difficulties. The simplex-cone SVM (SCSVM) of Mroueh et
  al. (2012) is a computationally efficient multicategory classifier, but its use
  has been limited by a seemingly opaque interpretation. We show that MSVM and SCSVM
  are in fact exactly equivalent, and provide a bijection between their tuning parameters.
  MSVM may then be entertained as both a natural and computationally efficient multicategory
  extension of SVM. We further provide a Donsker theorem for finite-dimensional kernel
  MSVM and partially answer the open question pertaining to the very competitive performance
  of One-vs-Rest methods against MSVM. Furthermore, we use the derived asymptotic
  covariance formula to develop an inverse-variance weighted classification rule which
  improves on the One-vs-Rest approach.
