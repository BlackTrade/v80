abstract: 'The sparse inverse covariance estimation problem is commonly solved using
  an $\ell_{1}$-regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator known as “graphical
  lasso”, but its computational cost becomes prohibitive for large data sets. A recently
  line of results showed{–}under mild assumptions{–}that the graphical lasso estimator
  can be retrieved by soft-thresholding the sample covariance matrix and solving a
  maximum determinant matrix completion (MDMC) problem. This paper proves an extension
  of this result, and describes a Newton-CG algorithm to efficiently solve the MDMC
  problem. Assuming that the thresholded sample covariance matrix is sparse with a
  sparse Cholesky factorization, we prove that the algorithm converges to an $ε$-accurate
  solution in $O(n\log(1/ε))$ time and $O(n)$ memory. The algorithm is highly efficient
  in practice: we solve the associated MDMC problems with as many as 200,000 variables
  to 7-9 digits of accuracy in less than an hour on a standard laptop computer running
  MATLAB.'
