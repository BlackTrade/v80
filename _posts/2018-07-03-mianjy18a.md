abstract: We revisit convex relaxation based methods for stochastic optimization of
  principal component analysis (PCA). While methods that directly solve the nonconvex
  problem have been shown to be optimal in terms of statistical and computational
  efficiency, the methods based on convex relaxation have been shown to enjoy comparable,
  or even superior, empirical performance â€“ this motivates the need for a deeper formal
  understanding of the latter. Therefore, in this paper, we study variants of stochastic
  gradient descent for a convex relaxation of PCA with (a) $\ell_2$, (b) $\ell_1$,
  and (c) elastic net ($\ell_1+\ell_2)$ regularization in the hope that these variants
  yield (a) better iteration complexity, (b) better control on the rank of the intermediate
  iterates, and (c) both, respectively. We show, theoretically and empirically, that
  compared to previous work on convex relaxation based methods, the proposed variants
  yield faster convergence and improve overall runtime to achieve a certain user-specified
  $\epsilon$-suboptimality on the PCA objective. Furthermore, the proposed methods
  are shown to converge both in terms of the PCA objective as well as the distance
  between subspaces. However, there still remains a gap in computational requirements
  for the proposed methods when compared with existing nonconvex approaches.
