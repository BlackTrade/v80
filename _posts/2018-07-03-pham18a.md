abstract: We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive
  approach for automatic model design. ENAS constructs a large computational graph,
  where each subgraph represents a neural network architecture, hence forcing all
  architectures to share their parameters. A controller is trained with policy gradient
  to search for a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on a validation set.
  Meanwhile a model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize
  a canonical cross entropy loss. Sharing parameters among child models allows ENAS
  to deliver strong empirical performances, whilst using much fewer GPU-hours than
  existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than
  standard Neural Architecture Search. On Penn Treebank, ENAS discovers a novel architecture
  that achieves a test perplexity of 56.3, on par with the existing state-of-the-art
  among all methods without post-training processing. On CIFAR-10, ENAS finds a novel
  architecture that achieves 2.89% test error, which is on par with the 2.65% test
  error of NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018).
