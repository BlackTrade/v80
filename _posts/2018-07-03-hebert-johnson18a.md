abstract: We develop and study multicalibration as a new measure of fairness in machine
  learning that aims to mitigate inadvertent or malicious discrimination that is introduced
  at training time (even from ground truth data). Multicalibration guarantees meaningful
  (calibrated) predictions for every subpopulation that can be identified within a
  specified class of computations. The specified class can be quite rich; in particular,
  it can contain many overlapping subgroups of a protected group. We demonstrate that
  in many settings this strong notion of protection from discrimination is provably
  attainable and aligned with the goal of obtaining accurate predictions. Along the
  way, we present algorithms for learning a multicalibrated predictor, study the computational
  complexity of this task, and illustrate tight connections to the agnostic learning
  model.
