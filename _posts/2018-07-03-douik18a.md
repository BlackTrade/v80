abstract: This paper develops a Riemannian optimization framework for solving optimization
  problems on the set of symmetric positive semidefinite stochastic matrices. The
  paper first reformulates the problem by factorizing the optimization variable as
  $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{Y}^T$ and deriving conditions on $p$, i.e., the number
  of columns of $\mathbf{Y}$, under which the factorization yields a satisfactory
  solution. The reparameterization of the problem allows its formulation as an optimization
  over either an embedded or quotient Riemannian manifold whose geometries are investigated.
  In particular, the paper explicitly derives the tangent space, Riemannian gradients
  and retraction operator that allow the design of efficient optimization methods
  on the proposed manifolds. The numerical results reveal that, when the optimal solution
  has a known low-rank, the resulting algorithms present a clear complexity advantage
  when compared with state-of-the-art Euclidean and Riemannian approaches for graph
  clustering applications.
