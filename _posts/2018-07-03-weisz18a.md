abstract: We consider the problem of configuring general-purpose solvers to run efficiently
  on problem instances drawn from an unknown distribution. The goal of the configurator
  is to find a configuration that runs fast on average on most instances, and do so
  with the least amount of total work. It can run a chosen solver on a random instance
  until the solver finishes or a timeout is reached. We propose LeapsAndBounds, an
  algorithm that tests configurations on randomly selected problem instances for longer
  and longer time. We prove that the capped expected runtime of the configuration
  returned by LeapsAndBounds is close to the optimal expected runtime, while our algorithmâ€™s
  running time is near-optimal. Our results show that LeapsAndBounds is more efficient
  than the recent algorithm of Kleinberg et al. (2017), which, to our knowledge, is
  the only other algorithm configuration method with non-trivial theoretical guarantees.
  Experimental results on configuring a public SAT solver on a new benchmark dataset
  also stand witness to the superiority of our method.
