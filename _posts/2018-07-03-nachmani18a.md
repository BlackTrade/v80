abstract: Learning-based Text To Speech systems have the potential to generalize from
  one speaker to the next and thus require a relatively short sample of any new voice.
  However, this promise is currently largely unrealized. We present a method that
  is designed to capture a new speaker from a short untranscribed audio sample. This
  is done by employing an additional network that given an audio sample, places the
  speaker in the embedding space. This network is trained as part of the speech synthesis
  system using various consistency losses. Our results demonstrate a greatly improved
  performance on both the dataset speakers, and, more importantly, when fitting new
  voices, even from very short samples.
