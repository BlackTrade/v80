abstract: 'We introduce and study two algorithms to accelerate greedy coordinate descent
  in theory and in practice: Accelerated Semi-Greedy Coordinate Descent (ASCD) and
  Accelerated Greedy Coordinate Descent (AGCD). On the theory side, our main results
  are for ASCD: we show that ASCD achieves $O(1/k^2)$ convergence, and it also achieves
  accelerated linear convergence for strongly convex functions. On the empirical side,
  while both AGCD and ASCD outperform Accelerated Randomized Coordinate Descent on
  most instances in our numerical experiments, we note that AGCD significantly outperforms
  the other two methods in our experiments, in spite of a lack of theoretical guarantees
  for this method. To complement this empirical finding for AGCD, we present an explanation
  why standard proof techniques for acceleration cannot work for AGCD, and we further
  introduce a technical condition under which AGCD is guaranteed to have accelerated
  convergence. Finally, we confirm that this technical condition holds in our numerical
  experiments.'
