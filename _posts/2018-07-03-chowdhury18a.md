abstract: 'Ridge regression is a variant of regularized least squares regression that
  is particularly suitable in settings where the number of predictor variables greatly
  exceeds the number of observations. We present a simple, iterative, sketching-based
  algorithm for ridge regression that guarantees high-quality approximations to the
  optimal solution vector. Our analysis builds upon two simple structural results
  that boil down to randomized matrix multiplication, a fundamental and well-understood
  primitive of randomized linear algebra. An important contribution of our work is
  the analysis of the behavior of subsampled ridge regression problems when the ridge
  leverage scores are used: we prove that accurate approximations can be achieved
  by a sample whose size depends on the degrees of freedom of the ridge-regression
  problem rather than the dimensions of the design matrix. Our experimental evaluations
  verify our theoretical results on both real and synthetic data.'
