abstract: 'In transfer learning, what and how to transfer are two primary issues to
  be addressed, as different transfer learning algorithms applied between a source
  and a target domain result in different knowledge transferred and thereby the performance
  improvement in the target domain. Determining the optimal one that maximizes the
  performance improvement requires either exhaustive exploration or considerable expertise.
  Meanwhile, it is widely accepted in educational psychology that human beings improve
  transfer learning skills of deciding what to transfer through meta-cognitive reflection
  on inductive transfer learning practices. Motivated by this, we propose a novel
  transfer learning framework known as Learning to Transfer (L2T) to automatically
  determine what and how to transfer are the best by leveraging previous transfer
  learning experiences. We establish the L2T framework in two stages: 1) we learn
  a reflection function encrypting transfer learning skills from experiences; and
  2) we infer what and how to transfer are the best for a future pair of domains by
  optimizing the reflection function. We also theoretically analyse the algorithmic
  stability and generalization bound of L2T, and empirically demonstrate its superiority
  over several state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.'
