abstract: One of the most compelling features of Gaussian process (GP) regression
  is its ability to provide well-calibrated posterior distributions. Recent advances
  in inducing point methods have sped up GP marginal likelihood and posterior mean
  computations, leaving posterior covariance estimation and sampling as the remaining
  computational bottlenecks. In this paper we address these shortcomings by using
  the Lanczos algorithm to rapidly approximate the predictive covariance matrix. Our
  approach, which we refer to as LOVE (LanczOs Variance Estimates), substantially
  improves time and space complexity. In our experiments, LOVE computes covariances
  up to 2,000 times faster and draws samples 18,000 times faster than existing methods,
  all without sacrificing accuracy.
