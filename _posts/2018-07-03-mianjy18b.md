abstract: Algorithmic approaches endow deep learning systems with implicit bias that
  helps them generalize even in over-parametrized settings. In this paper, we focus
  on understanding such a bias induced in learning through dropout, a popular technique
  to avoid overfitting in deep learning. For single hidden-layer linear neural networks,
  we show that dropout tends to make the norm of incoming/outgoing weight vectors
  of all the hidden nodes equal. In addition, we provide a complete characterization
  of the optimization landscape induced by dropout.
