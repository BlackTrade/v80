abstract: We consider the constrained optimization where the objective function and
  the constraints are defined as summation of finitely many loss functions. This model
  has applications in machine learning such as Neyman-Pearson classification. We consider
  two level-set methods to solve this class of problems, an existing inexact Newton
  method and a new feasible level-set method. To update the level parameter towards
  the optimality, both methods require an oracle that generates upper and lower bounds
  as well as an affine-minorant of the level function. To construct the desired oracle,
  we reformulate the level function as the value of a saddle-point problem using the
  conjugate and perspective of the loss functions. Then a stochastic variance-reduced
  gradient method with a special Bregman divergence is proposed as the oracle for
  solving that saddle-point problem. The special divergence ensures the proximal mapping
  in each iteration can be solved in a closed form. The total complexity of both level-set
  methods using the proposed oracle are analyzed.
