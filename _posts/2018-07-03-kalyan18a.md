abstract: Many structured prediction problems (particularly in vision and language
  domains) are ambiguous, with multiple outputs being ‘correct’ for an input – e.g.
  there are many ways of describing an image, multiple ways of translating a sentence;
  however, exhaustively annotating the applicability of all possible outputs is intractable
  due to exponentially large output spaces (e.g. all English sentences). In practice,
  these problems are cast as multi-class prediction, with the likelihood of only a
  sparse set of annotations being maximized – unfortunately penalizing for placing
  beliefs on plausible but unannotated outputs. We make and test the following hypothesis
  – for a given input, the annotations of its neighbors may serve as an additional
  supervisory signal. Specifically, we propose an objective that transfers supervision
  from neighboring examples. We first study the properties of our developed method
  in a controlled toy setup before reporting results on multi-label classification
  and two image-grounded sequence modeling tasks – captioning and question generation.
  We evaluate using standard task-specific metrics and measures of output diversity,
  finding consistent improvements over standard maximum likelihood training and other
  baselines.
