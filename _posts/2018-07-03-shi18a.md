abstract: Recently there have been increasing interests in learning and inference
  with implicit distributions (i.e., distributions without tractable densities). To
  this end, we develop a gradient estimator for implicit distributions based on Stein’s
  identity and a spectral decomposition of kernel operators, where the eigenfunctions
  are approximated by the Nyström method. Unlike the previous works that only provide
  estimates at the sample points, our approach directly estimates the gradient function,
  thus allows for a simple and principled out-of-sample extension. We provide theoretical
  results on the error bound of the estimator and discuss the bias-variance tradeoff
  in practice. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by applications to
  gradient-free Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference with implicit distributions.
  Finally, we discuss the intuition behind the estimator by drawing connections between
  the Nyström method and kernel PCA, which indicates that the estimator can automatically
  adapt to the geometry of the underlying distribution.
