abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian Network (BN) structure learning have focused
  on local-to-global learning, where the graph structure is learned via one local
  subgraph at a time. As a natural progression, we investigate parallel learning of
  BN structures via multiple learning agents simultaneously, where each agent learns
  one local subgraph at a time. We find that parallel learning can reduce the number
  of subgraphs requiring structure learning by storing previously queried results
  and communicating (even partial) results among agents. More specifically, by using
  novel rules on query subset and superset inference, many subgraph structures can
  be inferred without learning. We provide a sound and complete parallel structure
  learning (PSL) algorithm, and demonstrate its improved efficiency over state-of-the-art
  single-thread learning algorithms.
