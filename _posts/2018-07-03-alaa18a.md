abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is a
  central problem in many domains. Because counterfactual data is inaccessible, the
  problem differs fundamentally from supervised learning, and entails a more complex
  set of modeling choices. Despite a variety of recently proposed algorithmic solutions,
  a principled guideline for building estimators of treatment effects using machine
  learning algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide such a guideline
  by characterizing the fundamental limits of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects,
  and establishing conditions under which these limits can be achieved. Our analysis
  reveals that the relative importance of the different aspects of observational data
  vary with the sample size. For instance, we show that selection bias matters only
  in small-sample regimes, whereas with a large sample size, the way an algorithm
  models the control and treated outcomes is what bottlenecks its performance. Guided
  by our analysis, we build a practical algorithm for estimating treatment effects
  using a non-stationary Gaussian processes with doubly-robust hyperparameters. Using
  a standard semi-synthetic simulation setup, we show that our algorithm outperforms
  the state-of-the-art, and that the behavior of existing algorithms conforms with
  our analysis.
