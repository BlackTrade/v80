abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects fromobservational data is a central
  problem in manydomains. Because counterfactual data is inaccessible,the problem
  differs fundamentally fromsupervised learning, and entails a more complexset of
  modeling choices. Despite a variety of recentlyproposed algorithmic solutions, a
  principledguideline for building estimators of treatmenteffects using machine learning
  algorithmsis still lacking. In this paper, we provide such aguideline by characterizing
  the fundamental limitsof estimating heterogeneous treatment effects,and establishing
  conditions under which theselimits can be achieved. Our analysis reveals thatthe
  relative importance of the different aspectsof observational data vary with the
  sample size.For instance, we show that selection bias mattersonly in small-sample
  regimes, whereas witha large sample size, the way an algorithm modelsthe control
  and treated outcomes is what bottlenecksits performance. Guided by our analysis,we
  build a practical algorithm for estimatingtreatment effects using a non-stationary
  Gaussianprocesses with doubly-robust hyperparameters.Using a standard semi-synthetic
  simulationsetup, we show that our algorithm outperformsthe state-of-the-art, and
  that the behavior of existingalgorithms conforms with our analysis.
