abstract: Deep neural networks excel at function approximation, yet they are typically
  trained from scratch for each new function. On the other hand, Bayesian methods,
  such as Gaussian Processes (GPs), exploit prior knowledge to quickly infer the shape
  of a new function at test time. Yet, GPs are computationally expensive, and it can
  be hard to design appropriate priors. In this paper we propose a family of neural
  models, Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs), that combine the benefits of both.
  CNPs are inspired by the flexibility of stochastic processes such as GPs, but are
  structured as neural networks and trained via gradient descent. CNPs make accurate
  predictions after observing only a handful of training data points, yet scale to
  complex functions and large datasets. We demonstrate the performance and versatility
  of the approach on a range of canonical machine learning tasks, including regression,
  classification and image completion.
