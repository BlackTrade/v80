abstract: Neural networks can be compressed to reduce memory and computational requirements,
  or to increase accuracy by facilitating the use of a larger base architecture. In
  this paper we focus on pruning individual neurons, which can simultaneously trim
  model size, FLOPs, and run-time memory. To improve upon the performance of existing
  compression algorithms we utilize the information bottleneck principle instantiated
  via a tractable variational bound. Minimization of this information theoretic bound
  reduces the redundancy between adjacent layers by aggregating useful information
  into a subset of neurons that can be preserved. In contrast, the activations of
  disposable neurons are shut off via an attractive form of sparse regularization
  that emerges naturally from this framework, providing tangible advantages over traditional
  sparsity penalties without contributing additional tuning parameters to the energy
  landscape. We demonstrate state-of-the-art compression rates across an array of
  datasets and network architectures.
