abstract: 'In this paper, we present a local convergence anal- ysis for a class of
  stochastic optimisation meth- ods: the proximal variance reduced stochastic gradient
  methods, and mainly focus on SAGA (Defazio et al., 2014) and Prox-SVRG (Xiao & Zhang,
  2014). Under the assumption that the non-smooth component of the optimisation prob-
  lem is partly smooth relative to a smooth mani- fold, we present a unified framework
  for the local convergence analysis of SAGA/Prox-SVRG: (i) the sequences generated
  by the methods are able to identify the smooth manifold in a finite num- ber of
  iterations; (ii) then the sequence enters a local linear convergence regime. Furthermore,
  we discuss various possibilities for accelerating these algorithms, including adapting
  to better lo- cal parameters, and applying higher-order deter- ministic/stochastic
  optimisation methods which can achieve super-linear convergence. Several concrete
  examples arising from machine learning are considered to demonstrate the obtained
  result.'
