abstract: K-means clustering algorithm using Lloyd’s heuristic is one of the most
  commonly used tools in data mining and machine learning that shows promising performance.
  However, it suffers from a high computational cost resulting from pairwise Euclidean
  distance computations between data points and cluster centers in each iteration
  of Lloyd’s heuristic. Main contributing factor of this computational bottle neck
  is a matrix-vector multiplication step, where the matrix contains all the data points
  and the vector is a cluster center. In this paper we show that we can randomly sparsify
  the original data matrix resulting in a sparse data matrix which can significantly
  speed up the above mentioned matrix vector multiplication step without significantly
  affecting cluster quality. In particular, we show that optimal k-means clustering
  solution of the sparse data matrix, obtained by applying random matrix sparsification,
  results in an approximately optimal k-means clustering objective of the original
  data matrix. Our empirical studies on three real world datasets corroborate our
  theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed sparsification method can
  indeed achieve satisfactory clustering performance.
