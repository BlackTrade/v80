abstract: Despite the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image
  generation, the trade-off between visual quality and image diversity remains a significant
  issue. This paper achieves both aims simultaneously by improving the stability of
  training GANs. The key idea of the proposed approach is to implicitly regularize
  the discriminator using representative features. Focusing on the fact that standard
  GAN minimizes reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we transfer the representative
  feature, which is extracted from the data distribution using a pre-trained autoencoder
  (AE), to the discriminator of standard GANs. Because the AE learns to minimize forward
  KL divergence, our GAN training with representative features is influenced by both
  reverse and forward KL divergence. Consequently, the proposed approach is verified
  to improve visual quality and diversity of state of the art GANs using extensive
  evaluations.
