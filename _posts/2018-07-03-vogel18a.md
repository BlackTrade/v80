abstract: 'The performance of many machine learning techniques depends on the choice
  of an appropriate similarity or distance measure on the input space. Similarity
  learning (or metric learning) aims at building such a measure from training data
  so that observations with the same (resp. different) label are as close (resp. far)
  as possible. In this paper, similarity learning is investigated from the perspective
  of pairwise bipartite ranking, where the goal is to rank the elements of a database
  by decreasing order of the probability that they share the same label with some
  query data point, based on the similarity scores. A natural performance criterion
  in this setting is pointwise ROC optimization: maximize the true positive rate under
  a fixed false positive rate. We study this novel perspective on similarity learning
  through a rigorous probabilistic framework. The empirical version of the problem
  gives rise to a constrained optimization formulation involving U-statistics, for
  which we derive universal learning rates as well as faster rates under a noise assumption
  on the data distribution. We also address the large-scale setting by analyzing the
  effect of sampling-based approximations. Our theoretical results are supported by
  illustrative numerical experiments.'
