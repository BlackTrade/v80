abstract: 'Current neural network-based classifiers are susceptible to adversarial
  examples even in the black-box setting, where the attacker only has query access
  to the model. In practice, the threat model for real-world systems is often more
  restrictive than the typical black-box model where the adversary can observe the
  full output of the network on arbitrarily many chosen inputs. We define three realistic
  threat models that more accurately characterize many real-world classifiers: the
  query-limited setting, the partial-information setting, and the label-only setting.
  We develop new attacks that fool classifiers under these more restrictive threat
  models, where previous methods would be impractical or ineffective. We demonstrate
  that our methods are effective against an ImageNet classifier under our proposed
  threat models. We also demonstrate a targeted black-box attack against a commercial
  classifier, overcoming the challenges of limited query access, partial information,
  and other practical issues to break the Google Cloud Vision API.'
