abstract: We define and address the problem of unsupervised learning of disentangled
  representations on data generated from independent factors of variation. We propose
  FactorVAE, a method that disentangles by encouraging the distribution of representations
  to be factorial and hence independent across the dimensions. We show that it improves
  upon beta-VAE by providing a better trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction
  quality and being more robust to the number of training iterations. Moreover, we
  highlight the problems of a commonly used disentanglement metric and introduce a
  new metric that does not suffer from them.
