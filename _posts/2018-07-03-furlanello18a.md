abstract: 'Knowledge Distillation (KD) consists of transferring “knowledge” from one
  machine learning model (the teacher) to another (the student). Commonly, the teacher
  is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student is more
  compact. By transferring knowledge, one hopes to benefit from the student’s compactness,
  without sacrificing too much performance. We study KD from a new perspective: rather
  than compressing models, we train students parameterized identically to their teachers.
  Surprisingly, these Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly,
  both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs based
  on DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 (3.5%) and
  CIFAR-100 (15.5%) datasets, by validation error. Additional experiments explore
  two distillation objectives: (i) Confidence-Weighted by Teacher Max (CWTM) and (ii)
  Dark Knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP). Both methods elucidate the essential
  components of KD, demonstrating the effect of the teacher outputs on both predicted
  and non-predicted classes.'
