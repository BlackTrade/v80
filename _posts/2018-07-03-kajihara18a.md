abstract: We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for simulator-based
  statistical models with intractable likelihood. Our proposed method involves recursive
  application of kernel ABC and kernel herding to the same observed data. We provide
  a theoretical explanation regarding why the approach works, showing (for the population
  setting) that, under a certain assumption, point estimates obtained with this method
  converge to the true parameter, as recursion proceeds. We have conducted a variety
  of numerical experiments, including parameter estimation for a real-world pedestrian
  flow simulator, and show that in most cases our method outperforms existing approaches.
