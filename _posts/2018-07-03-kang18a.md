abstract: Exploration remains a significant challenge to reinforcement learning methods,
  especially in environments where reward signals are sparse. Recent methods of learning
  from demonstrations have shown to be promising in overcoming exploration difficulties
  but typically require considerable high-quality demonstrations that are difficult
  to collect. We propose to effectively leverage available demonstrations to guide
  exploration through enforcing occupancy measure matching between the learned policy
  and current demonstrations, and develop a novel Policy Optimization from Demonstration
  (POfD) method. We show that POfD induces implicit dynamic reward shaping and brings
  provable benefits for policy improvement. Furthermore, it can be combined with policy
  gradient methods to produce state-of-the-art results, as demonstrated experimentally
  on a range of popular benchmark sparse-reward tasks, even when the demonstrations
  are few and imperfect.
