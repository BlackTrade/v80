abstract: We develop the first Bayesian Optimization algorithm, BLOSSOM, which selects
  between multiple alternative acquisition functions and traditional local optimization
  at each step. This is combined with a novel stopping condition based on expected
  regret. This pairing allows us to obtain the best characteristics of both local
  and Bayesian optimization, making efficient use of function evaluations while yielding
  superior convergence to the global minimum on a selection of optimization problems,
  and also halting optimization once a principled and intuitive stopping condition
  has been fulfilled.
