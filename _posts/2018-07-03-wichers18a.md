abstract: Much of recent research has been devoted to video prediction and generation,
  yet most of the previous works have demonstrated only limited success in generating
  videos on short-term horizons. The hierarchical video prediction method by Villegas
  et al. (2017) is an example of a state-of-the-art method for long-term video prediction,
  but their method is limited because it requires ground truth annotation of high-level
  structures (e.g., human joint landmarks) at training time. Our network encodes the
  input frame, predicts a high-level encoding into the future, and then a decoder
  with access to the first frame produces the predicted image from the predicted encoding.
  The decoder also produces a mask that outlines the predicted foreground object (e.g.,
  person) as a by-product. Unlike Villegas et al. (2017), we develop a novel training
  method that jointly trains the encoder, the predictor, and the decoder together
  without highlevel supervision; we further improve upon this by using an adversarial
  loss in the feature space to train the predictor. Our method can predict about 20
  seconds into the future and provides better results compared to Denton and Fergus
  (2018) and Finn et al. (2016) on the Human 3.6M dataset.
