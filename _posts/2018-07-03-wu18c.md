abstract: In this paper, we propose a listwise approach for constructing user-specific
  rankings in recommendation systems in a collaborative fashion. We contrast the listwise
  approach to previous pointwise and pairwise approaches, which are based on treating
  either each rating or each pairwise comparison as an independent instance respectively.
  By extending the work of ListNet (Cao et al., 2007), we cast listwise collaborative
  ranking as maximum likelihood under a permutation model which applies probability
  mass to permutations based on a low rank latent score matrix. We present a novel
  algorithm called SQL-Rank, which can accommodate ties and missing data and can run
  in linear time. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing listwise ranking
  methods based on a novel representation theory for the permutation model. Applying
  this framework to collaborative ranking, we derive asymptotic statistical rates
  as the number of users and items grow together. We conclude by demonstrating that
  our SQL-Rank method often outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for implicit
  feedback such as Weighted-MF and BPR and achieve favorable results when compared
  to explicit feedback algorithms such as matrix factorization and collaborative ranking.
