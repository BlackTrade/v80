abstract: 'Modern health data science applications leverage abundant molecular and
  electronic health data, providing opportunities for machine learning to build statistical
  models to support clinical practice. Time-to-event analysis, also called survival
  analysis, stands as one of the most representative examples of such statistical
  models. We present a deep-network-based approach that leverages adversarial learning
  to address a key challenge in modern time-to-event modeling: nonparametric estimation
  of event-time distributions. We also introduce a principled cost function to exploit
  information from censored events (events that occur subsequent to the observation
  window). Unlike most time-to-event models, we focus on the estimation of time-to-event
  distributions, rather than time ordering. We validate our model on both benchmark
  and real datasets, demonstrating that the proposed formulation yields significant
  performance gains relative to a parametric alternative, which we also propose.'
