abstract: In many sequential planning applications a natural approach to generating
  high quality plans is to maximize an information reward such as mutual information
  (MI). Unfortunately, MI lacks a closed form in all but trivial models, and so must
  be estimated. In applications where the cost of plan execution is expensive, one
  desires planning estimates which admit theoretical guarantees. Through the use of
  robust M-estimators we obtain bounds on absolute deviation of estimated MI. Moreover,
  we propose a sequential algorithm which integrates inference and planning by maximally
  reusing particles in each stage. We validate the utility of using robust estimators
  in the sequential approach on a Gaussian Markov Random Field wherein information
  measures have a closed form. Lastly, we demonstrate the benefits of our integrated
  approach in the context of sequential experiment design for inferring causal regulatory
  networks from gene expression levels. Our method shows improvements over a recent
  method which selects intervention experiments based on the same MI objective.
