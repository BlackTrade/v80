abstract: We propose NetGAN - the first implicit generative model for graphs able
  to mimic real-world networks. We pose the problem of graph generation as learning
  the distribution of biased random walks over the input graph. The proposed model
  is based on a stochastic neural network that generates discrete output samples and
  is trained using the Wasserstein GAN objective. NetGAN is able to produce graphs
  that exhibit well-known network patterns without explicitly specifying them in the
  model definition. At the same time, our model exhibits strong generalization properties,
  as highlighted by its competitive link prediction performance, despite not being
  trained specifically for this task. Being the first approach to combine both of
  these desirable properties, NetGAN opens exciting avenues for further research.
