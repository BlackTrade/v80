abstract: We consider the problem of learning a low-rank matrix, constrained to lie
  in a linear subspace, and introduce a novel factorization for modeling such matrices.
  A salient feature of the proposed factorization scheme is it decouples the low-rank
  and the structural constraints onto separate factors. We formulate the optimization
  problem on the Riemannian spectrahedron manifold, where the Riemannian framework
  allows to develop computationally efficient conjugate gradient and trust-region
  algorithms. Experiments on problems such as standard/robust/non-negative matrix
  completion, Hankel matrix learning and multi-task learning demonstrate the efficacy
  of our approach.
