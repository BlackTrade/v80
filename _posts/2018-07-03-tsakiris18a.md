abstract: Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) is a popular unsupervised machine learning
  method for clustering data lying close to an unknown union of low-dimensional linear
  subspaces; a problem with numerous applications in pattern recognition and computer
  vision. Even though the behavior of SSC for complete data is by now well-understood,
  little is known about its theoretical properties when applied to data with missing
  entries. In this paper we give theoretical guarantees for SSC with incomplete data,
  and provide theoretical evidence that projecting the zero-filled data onto the observation
  pattern of the point being expressed can lead to substantial improvement in performance;
  a phenomenon already known experimentally. The main insight of our analysis is that
  even though this projection induces additional missing entries, this is counterbalanced
  by the fact that the projected and zero-filled data are in effect incomplete points
  associated with the union of the corresponding projected subspaces, with respect
  to which the point being expressed is complete. The significance of this phenomenon
  potentially extends to the entire class of self-expressive methods.
