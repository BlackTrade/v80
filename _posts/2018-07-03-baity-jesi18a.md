abstract: We analyze numerically the training dynamics of deep neural networks (DNN)
  by using methods developed in statistical physics of glassy systems. The two main
  issues we address are the complexity of the loss-landscape and of the dynamics within
  it, and to what extent DNNs share similarities with glassy systems. Our findings,
  obtained for different architectures and data-sets, suggest that during the training
  process the dynamics slows down because of an increasingly large number of flat
  directions. At large times, when the loss is approaching zero, the system diffuses
  at the bottom of the landscape. Despite some similarities with the dynamics of mean-field
  glassy systems, in particular, the absence of barrier crossing, we find distinctive
  dynamical behaviors in the two cases, thus showing that the statistical properties
  of the corresponding loss and energy landscapes are different. In contrast, when
  the network is under-parametrized we observe a typical glassy behavior, thus suggesting
  the existence of different phases depending on whether the network is under-parametrized
  or over-parametrized.
