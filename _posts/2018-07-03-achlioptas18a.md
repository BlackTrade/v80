abstract: Three-dimensional geometric data offer an excellent domain for studying
  representation learning and generative modeling. In this paper, we look at geometric
  data represented as point clouds. We introduce a deep AutoEncoder (AE) network with
  state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and generalization ability. The learned
  representations outperform existing methods on 3D recognition tasks and enable shape
  editing via simple algebraic manipulations, such as semantic part editing, shape
  analogies and shape interpolation, as well as shape completion. We perform a thorough
  study of different generative models including GANs operating on the raw point clouds,
  significantly improved GANs trained in the fixed latent space of our AEs, and Gaussian
  Mixture Models (GMMs). To quantitatively evaluate generative models we introduce
  measures of sample fidelity and diversity based on matchings between sets of point
  clouds. Interestingly, our evaluation of generalization, fidelity and diversity
  reveals that GMMs trained in the latent space of our AEs yield the best results
  overall.
