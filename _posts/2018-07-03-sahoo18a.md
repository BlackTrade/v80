abstract: We present an approach to identify concise equations from data using a shallow
  neural network approach. In contrast to ordinary black-box regression, this approach
  allows understanding functional relations and generalizing them from observed data
  to unseen parts of the parameter space. We show how to extend the class of learnable
  equations for a recently proposed equation learning network to include divisions,
  and we improve the learning and model selection strategy to be useful for challenging
  real-world data. For systems governed by analytical expressions, our method can
  in many cases identify the true underlying equation and extrapolate to unseen domains.
  We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on a cart-pendulum system, where
  only 2 random rollouts are required to learn the forward dynamics and successfully
  achieve the swing-up task.
