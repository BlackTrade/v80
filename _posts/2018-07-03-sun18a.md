abstract: Interpreting decision making logic in demonstration videos is key to collaborating
  with and mimicking humans. To empower machines with this ability, we propose a neural
  program synthesizer that is able to explicitly synthesize underlying programs from
  behaviorally diverse and visually complicated demonstration videos. We introduce
  a summarizer module as part of our model to improve the networkâ€™s ability to integrate
  multiple demonstrations varying in behavior. We also employ a multi-task objective
  to encourage the model to learn meaningful intermediate representations for end-to-end
  training. We show that our model is able to reliably synthesize underlying programs
  as well as capture diverse behaviors exhibited in demonstrations. The code is available
  at https://shaohua0116.github.io/demo2program.
