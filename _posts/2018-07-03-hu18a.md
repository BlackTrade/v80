abstract: 'Distributionally Robust Supervised Learning (DRSL) is necessary for building
  reliable machine learning systems. When machine learning is deployed in the real
  world, its performance can be significantly degraded because test data may follow
  a different distribution from training data. DRSL with f-divergences explicitly
  considers the worst-case distribution shift by minimizing the adversarially reweighted
  training loss. In this paper, we analyze this DRSL, focusing on the classification
  scenario. Since the DRSL is explicitly formulated for a distribution shift scenario,
  we naturally expect it to give a robust classifier that can aggressively handle
  shifted distributions. However, surprisingly, we prove that the DRSL just ends up
  giving a classifier that exactly fits the given training distribution, which is
  too pessimistic. This pessimism comes from two sources: the particular losses used
  in classification and the fact that the variety of distributions to which the DRSL
  tries to be robust is too wide. Motivated by our analysis, we propose simple DRSL
  that overcomes this pessimism and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness.'
