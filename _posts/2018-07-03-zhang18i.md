abstract: We establish, for the first time, explicit connections between feedforward
  neural networks with ReLU activation and tropical geometry â€” we show that the family
  of such neural networks is equivalent to the family of tropical rational maps. Among
  other things, we deduce that feedforward ReLU neural networks with one hidden layer
  can be characterized by zonotopes, which serve as building blocks for deeper networks;
  we relate decision boundaries of such neural networks to tropical hypersurfaces,
  a major object of study in tropical geometry; and we prove that linear regions of
  such neural networks correspond to vertices of polytopes associated with tropical
  rational functions. An insight from our tropical formulation is that a deeper network
  is exponentially more expressive than a shallow network.
