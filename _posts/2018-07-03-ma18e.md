abstract: 'We consider an $\ell_2$-regularized non-convex optimization problem for
  recovering signals from their noisy phaseless observations. We design and study
  the performance of a message passing algorithm that aims to solve this optimization
  problem. We consider the asymptotic setting $m,n \rightarrow \infty$, $m/n \rightarrow
  \delta$ and obtain sharp performance bounds, where $m$ is the number of measurements
  and $n$ is the signal dimension. We show that for complex signals the algorithm
  can perform accurate recovery with only $m=\left ( \frac{64}{\pi^2}-4\right)n\approx
  2.5n$ measurements. Also, we provide sharp analysis on the sensitivity of the algorithm
  to noise. We highlight the following facts about our message passing algorithm:
  (i) Adding $\ell_2$ regularization to the non-convex loss function can be beneficial
  even in the noiseless setting; (ii) spectral initialization has marginal impact
  on the performance of the algorithm.'
