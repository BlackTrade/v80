abstract: 'It is widely conjectured that training algorithms for neural networks are
  successful because all local minima lead to similar performance; for example, see
  (LeCun et al., 2015; Choromanska et al., 2015; Dauphin et al., 2014). Performance
  is typically measured in terms of two metrics: training performance and generalization
  performance. Here we focus on the training performance of neural networks for binary
  classification, and provide conditions under which the training error is zero at
  all local minima of appropriately chosen surrogate loss functions. Our conditions
  are roughly in the following form: the neurons have to be increasing and strictly
  convex, the neural network should either be single-layered or is multi-layered with
  a shortcut-like connection, and the surrogate loss function should be a smooth version
  of hinge loss. We also provide counterexamples to show that, when these conditions
  are relaxed, the result may not hold.'
