abstract: 'One of the most widely used optimization methodsfor large-scale machine
  learning problemsis distributed asynchronous stochastic gradientdescent (DASGD).
  However, a key issue thatarises here is that of delayed gradients: when a“worker”
  node asynchronously contributes a gradientupdate to the “master”, the global modelparameter
  may have changed, rendering this informationstale. In massively parallel computinggrids,
  these delays can quickly add up if the computationalthroughput of a node is saturated,
  sothe convergence of DASGD is uncertain underthese conditions. Nevertheless, by
  using a judiciouslychosen quasilinear step-size sequence, weshow that it is possible
  to amortize these delaysand achieve global convergence with probability1, even when
  the delays grow at a polynomialrate. In this way, our results help reaffirm thesuccessful
  application of DASGD to large-scaleoptimization problems.'
