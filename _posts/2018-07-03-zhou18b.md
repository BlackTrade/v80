abstract: 'One of the most widely used optimization methods for large-scale machine
  learning problems is distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (DASGD).
  However, a key issue that arises here is that of delayed gradients: when a “worker”
  node asynchronously contributes a gradient update to the “master”, the global model
  parameter may have changed, rendering this information stale. In massively parallel
  computing grids, these delays can quickly add up if the computational throughput
  of a node is saturated, so the convergence of DASGD is uncertain under these conditions.
  Nevertheless, by using a judiciously chosen quasilinear step-size sequence, we show
  that it is possible to amortize these delays and achieve global convergence with
  probability 1, even when the delays grow at a polynomial rate. In this way, our
  results help reaffirm the successful application of DASGD to large-scale optimization
  problems.'
