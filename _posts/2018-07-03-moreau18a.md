abstract: In this paper, we introduce DICOD, a convolutional sparse coding algorithm
  which builds shift invariant representations for long signals. This algorithm is
  designed to run in a distributed setting, with local message passing, making it
  communication efficient. It is based on coordinate descent and uses locally greedy
  updates which accelerate the resolution compared to greedy coordinate selection.
  We prove the convergence of this algorithm and highlight its computational speed-up
  which is super-linear in the number of cores used. We also provide empirical evidence
  for the acceleration properties of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods.
