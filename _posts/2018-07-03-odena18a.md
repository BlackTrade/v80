abstract: 'Recent work suggests that controlling the entire distribution of Jacobian
  singular values is an important design consideration in deep learning. Motivated
  by this, we study the distribution of singular values of the Jacobian of the generator
  in Generative Adversarial Networks. We find that this Jacobian generally becomes
  ill-conditioned at the beginning of training. Moreover, we find that the average
  (across the latent space) conditioning of the generator is highly predictive of
  two other ad-hoc metrics for measuring the “quality” of trained GANs: the Inception
  Score and the Frechet Inception Distance. We then test the hypothesis that this
  relationship is causal by proposing a “regularization” technique (called Jacobian
  Clamping) that softly penalizes the condition number of the generator Jacobian.
  Jacobian Clamping improves the mean score for nearly all datasets on which we tested
  it. It also greatly reduces inter-run variance of the aforementioned scores, addressing
  (at least partially) one of the main criticisms of GANs.'
