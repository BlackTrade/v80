abstract: 'Recent work suggests that controlling the entiredistribution of Jacobian
  singular values is animportant design consideration in deep learning.Motivated by
  this, we study the distribution ofsingular values of the Jacobian of the generator
  inGenerative Adversarial Networks. We find thatthis Jacobian generally becomes ill-conditionedat
  the beginning of training. Moreover, we findthat the average (across the latent
  space) conditioningof the generator is highly predictiveof two other ad-hoc metrics
  for measuring the“quality” of trained GANs: the Inception Scoreand the Frechet Inception
  Distance. We thentest the hypothesis that this relationship is causalby proposing
  a “regularization” technique (calledJacobian Clamping) that softly penalizes the
  conditionnumber of the generator Jacobian. JacobianClamping improves the mean score
  fornearly all datasets on which we tested it. It alsogreatly reduces inter-run variance
  of the aforementionedscores, addressing (at least partially)one of the main criticisms
  of GANs.'
