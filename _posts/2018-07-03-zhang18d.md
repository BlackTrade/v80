abstract: The computation of convolution layers in deep neural networkstypically rely
  on high performance routines that tradespace for time by using additional memory
  (either for packing purposesor required as part of the algorithm) to improve performance.
  Theproblems with such an approach are two-fold. First, these routinesincur additional
  memory overhead which reduces the overall size of thenetwork that can fit on embedded
  devices with limited memory capacity. Second, these high performance routines were
  not optimized for performing convolution, which means that the performance obtained
  is usually less than conventionally expected. Inthis paper, we demonstrate that
  direct convolution,when implemented correctly, eliminates allmemory overhead, and
  yields performance that isbetween 10% to 400% times better than existinghigh performance
  implementations of convolutionlayers on conventional and embedded CPU architectures.We
  also show that a high performancedirect convolution exhibits better scaling performance,i.e.
  suffers less performance drop, whenincreasing the number of threads.
