abstract: The computation of convolution layers in deep neural networks typically
  rely on high performance routines that trade space for time by using additional
  memory (either for packing purposes or required as part of the algorithm) to improve
  performance. The problems with such an approach are two-fold. First, these routines
  incur additional memory overhead which reduces the overall size of the network that
  can fit on embedded devices with limited memory capacity. Second, these high performance
  routines were not optimized for performing convolution, which means that the performance
  obtained is usually less than conventionally expected. In this paper, we demonstrate
  that direct convolution, when implemented correctly, eliminates all memory overhead,
  and yields performance that is between 10% to 400% times better than existing high
  performance implementations of convolution layers on conventional and embedded CPU
  architectures. We also show that a high performance direct convolution exhibits
  better scaling performance, i.e. suffers less performance drop, when increasing
  the number of threads.
