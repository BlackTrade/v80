abstract: The past few years have witnessed growth in the computational requirements
  for training deep convolutional neural networks. Current approaches parallelize
  training onto multiple devices by applying a single parallelization strategy (e.g.,
  data or model parallelism) to all layers in a network. Although easy to reason about,
  these approaches result in suboptimal runtime performance in large-scale distributed
  training, since different layers in a network may prefer different parallelization
  strategies. In this paper, we propose layer-wise parallelism that allows each layer
  in a network to use an individual parallelization strategy. We jointly optimize
  how each layer is parallelized by solving a graph search problem. Our evaluation
  shows that layer-wise parallelism outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by increasing
  training throughput, reducing communication costs, achieving better scalability
  to multiple GPUs, while maintaining original network accuracy.
