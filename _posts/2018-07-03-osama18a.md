abstract: We address the problem of predicting spatio-temporal processes with temporal
  patterns that vary across spatial regions, when data is obtained as a stream. That
  is, when the training dataset is augmented sequentially. Specifically, we develop
  a localized spatio-temporal covariance model of the process that can capture spatially
  varying temporal periodicities in the data. We then apply a covariance-fitting methodology
  to learn the model parameters which yields a predictor that can be updated sequentially
  with each new data point. The proposed method is evaluated using both synthetic
  and real climate data which demonstrate its ability to accurately predict data missing
  in spatial regions over time.
