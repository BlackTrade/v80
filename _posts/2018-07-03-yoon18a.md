abstract: We propose a novel method for imputing missing data by adapting the well-known
  Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. Accordingly, we call our method Generative
  Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN). The generator (G) observes some components of
  a real data vector, imputes the missing components conditioned on what is actually
  observed, and outputs a completed vector. The discriminator (D) then takes a completed
  vector and attempts to determine which components were actually observed and which
  were imputed. To ensure that D forces G to learn the desired distribution, we provide
  D with some additional information in the form of a hint vector. The hint reveals
  to D partial information about the missingness of the original sample, which is
  used by D to focus its attention on the imputation quality of particular components.
  This hint ensures that G does in fact learn to generate according to the true data
  distribution. We tested our method on various datasets and found that GAIN significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods.
