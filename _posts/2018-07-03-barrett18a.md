abstract: Whether neural networks can learn abstract reasoning or whether they merely
  rely on superficial statistics is a topic of recent debate. Here, we propose a dataset
  and challenge designed to probe abstract reasoning, inspired by a well-known human
  IQ test. To succeed at this challenge, models must cope with various generalisation
  ’regimes’ in which the training data and test questions differ in clearly-defined
  ways. We show that popular models such as ResNets perform poorly, even when the
  training and test sets differ only minimally, and we present a novel architecture,
  with structure designed to encourage reasoning, that does significantly better.
  When we vary the way in which the test questions and training data differ, we find
  that our model is notably proficient at certain forms of generalisation, but notably
  weak at others. We further show that the model’s ability to generalise improves
  markedly if it is trained to predict symbolic explanations for its answers. Altogether,
  we introduce and explore ways to both measure and induce stronger abstract reasoning
  in neural networks. Our freely-available dataset should motivate further progress
  in this direction.
