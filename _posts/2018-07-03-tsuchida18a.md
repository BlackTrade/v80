abstract: An interesting approach to analyzing neural networks that has received renewed
  attention is to examine the equivalent kernel of the neural network. This is based
  on the fact that a fully connected feedforward network with one hidden layer, a
  certain weight distribution, an activation function, and an infinite number of neurons
  can be viewed as a mapping into a Hilbert space. We derive the equivalent kernels
  of MLPs with ReLU or Leaky ReLU activations for all rotationally-invariant weight
  distributions, generalizing a previous result that required Gaussian weight distributions.
  Additionally, the Central Limit Theorem is used to show that for certain activation
  functions, kernels corresponding to layers with weight distributions having $0$
  mean and finite absolute third moment are asymptotically universal, and are well
  approximated by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights.
  In deep networks, as depth increases the equivalent kernel approaches a pathological
  fixed point, which can be used to argue why training randomly initialized networks
  can be difficult. Our results also have implications for weight initialization.
