abstract: Previously, the exploding gradient problem has been explained to be central
  in deep learning and model-based reinforcement learning, because it causes numerical
  issues and instability in optimization. Our experiments in model-based reinforcement
  learning imply that the problem is not just a numerical issue, but it may be caused
  by a fundamental chaos-like nature of long chains of nonlinear computations. Not
  only do the magnitudes of the gradients become large, the direction of the gradients
  becomes essentially random. We show that reparameterization gradients suffer from
  the problem, while likelihood ratio gradients are robust. Using our insights, we
  develop a model-based policy search framework, Probabilistic Inference for Particle-Based
  Policy Search (PIPPS), which is easily extensible, and allows for almost arbitrary
  models and policies, while simultaneously matching the performance of previous data-efficient
  learning algorithms. Finally, we invent the total propagation algorithm, which efficiently
  computes a union over all pathwise derivative depths during a single backwards pass,
  automatically giving greater weight to estimators with lower variance, sometimes
  improving over reparameterization gradients by $10^6$ times.
