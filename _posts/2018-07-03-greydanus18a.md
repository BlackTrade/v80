abstract: While deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) agents are effective at maximizing
  rewards, it is often unclear what strategies they use to do so. In this paper, we
  take a step toward explaining deep RL agents through a case study using Atari 2600
  environments. In particular, we focus on using saliency maps to understand how an
  agent learns and executes a policy. We introduce a method for generating useful
  saliency maps and use it to show 1) what strong agents attend to, 2) whether agents
  are making decisions for the right or wrong reasons, and 3) how agents evolve during
  learning. We also test our method on non-expert human subjects and find that it
  improves their ability to reason about these agents. Overall, our results show that
  saliency information can provide significant insight into an RL agentâ€™s decisions
  and learning behavior.
