abstract: Approximate linear programming (ALP) represents one of the major algorithmic
  families to solve large-scale Markov decision processes (MDP). In this work, we
  study a primal-dual formulation of the ALP, and develop a scalable, model-free algorithm
  called bilinear $\pi$ learning for reinforcement learning when a sampling oracle
  is provided. This algorithm enjoys a number of advantages. First, it adopts linear
  and bilinear models to represent the high-dimensional value function and state-action
  distributions, respectively, using given state and action features. Its run-time
  complexity depends on the number of features, not the size of the underlying MDPs.
  Second, it operates in a fully online fashion without having to store any sample,
  thus having minimal memory footprint. Third, we prove that it is sample-efficient,
  solving for the optimal policy to high precision with a sample complexity linear
  in the dimension of the parameter space.
