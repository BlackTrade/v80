abstract: Standard methods for generating adversarial examples for neural networks
  do not consistently fool neural network classifiers in the physical world due to
  a combination of viewpoint shifts, camera noise, and other natural transformations,
  limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We demonstrate the existence of
  robust 3D adversarial objects, and we present the first algorithm for synthesizing
  examples that are adversarial over a chosen distribution of transformations. We
  synthesize two-dimensional adversarial images that are robust to noise, distortion,
  and affine transformation. We apply our algorithm to complex three-dimensional objects,
  using 3D-printing to manufacture the first physical adversarial objects. Our results
  demonstrate the existence of 3D adversarial objects in the physical world.
