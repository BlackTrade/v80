abstract: We provide a second-order stochastic differential equation (SDE), which
  characterizes the continuous-time dynamics of accelerated stochastic mirror descent
  (ASMD) for strongly convex functions. This SDE plays a central role in designing
  new discrete-time ASMD algorithms via numerical discretization, and providing neat
  analyses of their convergence rates based on Lyapunov functions. Our results suggest
  that the only existing ASMD algorithm, namely, AC-SA proposed in Ghadimi & Lan (2012)
  is one instance of its kind, and we can actually derive new instances of ASMD with
  fewer tuning parameters. This sheds light on revisiting accelerated stochastic optimization
  through the lens of SDEs, which can lead to a better understanding of acceleration
  in stochastic optimization, as well as new simpler algorithms. Numerical experiments
  on both synthetic and real data support our theory.
