abstract: Modern reinforcement learning algorithms reach super-human performance on
  many board and video games, but they are sample inefficient, i.e. they typically
  require significantly more playing experience than humans to reach an equal performance
  level. To improve sample efficiency, an agent may build a model of the environment
  and use planning methods to update its policy. In this article we introduce Variational
  State Tabulation (VaST), which maps an environment with a high-dimensional state
  space (e.g. the space of visual inputs) to an abstract tabular model. Prioritized
  sweeping with small backups, a highly efficient planning method, can then be used
  to update state-action values. We show how VaST can rapidly learn to maximize reward
  in tasks like 3D navigation and efficiently adapt to sudden changes in rewards or
  transition probabilities.
