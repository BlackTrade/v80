abstract: We propose a stochastic variance-reduced cubic regularized Newton method
  (SVRC) for non-convex optimization. At the core of our algorithm is a novel semi-stochastic
  gradient along with a semi-stochastic Hessian, which are specifically designed for
  cubic regularization method. We show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge
  to an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-approximate local minimum within $\tilde{O}(n^{4/5}/\epsilon^{3/2})$
  second-order oracle calls, which outperforms the state-of-the-art cubic regularization
  algorithms including subsampled cubic regularization. Our work also sheds light
  on the application of variance reduction technique to high-order non-convex optimization
  methods. Thorough experiments on various non-convex optimization problems support
  our theory.
