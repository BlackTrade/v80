abstract: Phase retrieval refers to the problem of recovering real- or complex-valued
  vectors from magnitude measurements. The best-known algorithms for this problem
  are iterative in nature and rely on so-called spectral initializers that provide
  accurate initialization vectors. We propose a novel class of estimators suitable
  for general nonlinear measurement systems, called linear spectral estimators (LSPEs),
  which can be used to compute accurate initialization vectors for phase retrieval
  problems. The proposed LSPEs not only provide accurate initialization vectors for
  noisy phase retrieval systems with structured or random measurement matrices, but
  also enable the derivation of sharp and nonasymptotic mean-squared error bounds.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of LSPEs on synthetic and real-world phase retrieval
  problems, and we show that our estimators significantly outperform existing methods
  for structured measurement systems that arise in practice.
