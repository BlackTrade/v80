abstract: Gaussian process modulated Poisson processes provide a flexible framework
  for modeling spatiotemporal point patterns. So far this had been restricted to one
  dimension, binning to a pre-determined grid, or small data sets of up to a few thousand
  data points. Here we introduce Cox process inference based on Fourier features.
  This sparse representation induces global rather than local constraints on the function
  space and is computationally efficient. This allows us to formulate a grid-free
  approximation that scales well with the number of data points and the size of the
  domain. We demonstrate that this allows MCMC approximations to the non-Gaussian
  posterior. In practice, we find that Fourier features have more consistent optimization
  behavior than previous approaches. Our approximate Bayesian method can fit over
  100 000 events with complex spatiotemporal patterns in three dimensions on a single
  GPU.
