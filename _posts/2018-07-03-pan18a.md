abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach
  to control dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (PDE).
  This paper shows how to use RL to tackle more general PDE control problems that
  have continuous high-dimensional action spaces with spatial relationship among action
  dimensions. In particular, we propose the concept of action descriptors, which encode
  regularities among spatially-extended action dimensions and enable the agent to
  control high-dimensional action PDEs. We provide theoretical evidence suggesting
  that this approach can be more sample efficient compared to a conventional approach
  that treats each action dimension separately and does not explicitly exploit the
  spatial regularity of the action space. The action descriptor approach is then used
  within the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Experiments on two PDE
  control problems, with up to 256-dimensional continuous actions, show the advantage
  of the proposed approach over the conventional one.
