abstract: In this paper we study leveraging <em>confidence information</em> induced
  by adversarial training to reinforce adversarial robustness of a given adversarially
  trained model. A natural measure of confidence is $\|F(x)\|_\infty$ (i.e. how confident
  $F$ is about its prediction?). We start by analyzing an adversarial training formulation
  proposed by Madry et al.. We demonstrate that, under a variety of instantiations,
  an only somewhat good solution to their objective induces confidence to be a discriminator,
  which can distinguish between right and wrong model predictions in a neighborhood
  of a point sampled from the underlying distribution. Based on this, we propose Highly
  Confident Near Neighbor (HCNN) a framework that combines confidence information
  and nearest neighbor search, to reinforce adversarial robustness of a base model.
  We give algorithms in this framework and perform a detailed empirical study. We
  report encouraging experimental results that support our analysis, and also discuss
  problems we observed with existing adversarial training.
