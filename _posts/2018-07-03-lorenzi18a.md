abstract: We introduce a novel generative formulation of deep probabilistic models
  implementing "soft" constraints on their function dynamics. In particular, we develop
  a flexible methodological framework where the modeled functions and derivatives
  of a given order are subject to inequality or equality constraints. We then characterize
  the posterior distribution over model and constraint parameters through stochastic
  variational inference. As a result, the proposed approach allows for accurate and
  scalable uncertainty quantification on the predictions and on all parameters. We
  demonstrate the application of equality constraints in the challenging problem of
  parameter inference in ordinary differential equation models, while we showcase
  the application of inequality constraints on the problem of monotonic regression
  of count data. The proposed approach is extensively tested in several experimental
  settings, leading to highly competitive results in challenging modeling applications,
  while offering high expressiveness, flexibility and scalability.
