abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning. Popular methods
  like K-means, may suffer from instability as they are prone to get stuck in its
  local minima. Recently, the sumof-norms (SON) model (also known as clustering path),
  which is a convex relaxation of hierarchical clustering model, has been proposed
  in (Lindsten et al., 2011) and (Hocking et al., 2011). Although numerical algorithms
  like alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and alternating minimization
  algorithm (AMA) have been proposed to solve convex clustering model (Chi & Lange,
  2015), it is known to be very challenging to solve large-scale problems. In this
  paper, we propose a semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method for large-scale
  convex clustering problems. Extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and
  real data demonstrate that our algorithm is highly efficient and robust for solving
  large-scale problems. Moreover, the numerical results also show the superior performance
  and scalability of our algorithm comparing to existing first-order methods.
