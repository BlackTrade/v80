abstract: The optimization of submodular functions on the integer lattice has received
  much attention recently, but the objective functions of many applications are non-submodular.
  We provide two approximation algorithms for maximizing a non-submodular function
  on the integer lattice subject to a cardinality constraint; these are the first
  algorithms for this purpose that have polynomial query complexity. We propose a
  general framework for influence maximization on the integer lattice that generalizes
  prior works on this topic, and we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms in
  this context.
