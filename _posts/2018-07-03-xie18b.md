abstract: Variable selection is a classic problem in machine learning (ML), widely
  used to find important explanatory factors, and improve generalization performance
  and interpretability of ML models. In this paper, we consider variable selection
  for models where multiple responses are to be predicted based on the same set of
  covariates. Since each response is relevant to a unique subset of covariates, we
  desire the selected variables for different responses have small overlap. We propose
  a regularizer that simultaneously encourage orthogonality and sparsity, which jointly
  brings in an effect of reducing overlap. We apply this regularizer to four model
  instances and develop efficient algorithms to solve the regularized problems. We
  provide a formal analysis on why the proposed regularizer can reduce generalization
  error. Experiments on both simulation studies and real-world datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer in selecting less-overlapped variables
  and improving generalization performance.
