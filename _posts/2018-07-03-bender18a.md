abstract: There is growing interest in automating neural network architecture design.
  Existing architecture search methods can be computationally expensive, requiring
  thousands of different architectures to be trained from scratch. Recent work has
  explored <em>weight sharing</em> across models to amortize the cost of training.
  Although previous methods reduced the cost of architecture search by orders of magnitude,
  they remain complex, requiring hypernetworks or reinforcement learning controllers.
  We aim to understand weight sharing for one-shot architecture search. With careful
  experimental analysis, we show that it is possible to efficiently identify promising
  architectures from a complex search space without either hypernetworks or RL.
