abstract: 'Structured prediction requires searching over a combinatorial number of
  structures. To tackle it, we introduce SparseMAP, a new method for sparse structured
  inference, together with corresponding loss functions. SparseMAP inference is able
  to automatically select only a few global structures: it is situated between MAP
  inference, which picks a single structure, and marginal inference, which assigns
  probability mass to all structures, including implausible ones. Importantly, SparseMAP
  can be computed using only calls to a MAP oracle, hence it is applicable even to
  problems where marginal inference is intractable, such as linear assignment. Moreover,
  thanks to the solution sparsity, gradient backpropagation is efficient regardless
  of the structure. SparseMAP thus enables us to augment deep neural networks with
  generic and sparse structured hidden layers. Experiments in dependency parsing and
  natural language inference reveal competitive accuracy, improved interpretability,
  and the ability to capture natural language ambiguities, which is attractive for
  pipeline systems.'
