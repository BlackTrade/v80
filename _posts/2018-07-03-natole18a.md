abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms such as SGDs update the model sequentially
  with cheap per-iteration costs, making them amenable for large-scale data analysis.
  However, most of the existing studies focus on the classification accuracy which
  can not be directly applied to the important problems of maximizing the Area under
  the ROC curve (AUC) in imbalanced classification and bipartite ranking. In this
  paper, we develop a novel stochastic proximal algorithm for AUC maximization which
  is referred to as SPAM. Compared with the previous literature, our algorithm SPAM
  applies to a non-smooth penalty function, and achieves a convergence rate of O(log
  t/t) for strongly convex functions while both space and per-iteration costs are
  of one datum.
