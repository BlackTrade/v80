abstract: Variance reduction has been commonly used in stochastic optimization. It
  relies crucially on the assumption that the data set is finite. However, when the
  data are imputed with random noise as in data augmentation, the perturbed data set
  becomes essentially infinite. Recently, the stochastic MISO (S-MISO) algorithm is
  introduced to address this expected risk minimization problem. Though it converges
  faster than SGD, a significant amount of memory is required. In this paper, we propose
  two SGD-like algorithms for expected risk minimization with random perturbation,
  namely, stochastic sample average gradient (SSAG) and stochastic SAGA (S-SAGA).
  The memory cost of SSAG does not depend on the sample size, while that of S-SAGA
  is the same as those of variance reduction methods on unperturbed data. Theoretical
  analysis and experimental results on logistic regression and AUC maximization show
  that SSAG has faster convergence rate than SGD with comparable space requirement
  while S-SAGA outperforms S-MISO in terms of both iteration complexity and storage.
