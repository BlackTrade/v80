abstract: The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has proven to be an effective model for
  producing semantically meaningful latent representations for natural data. However,
  it has thus far seen limited application to sequential data, and, as we demonstrate,
  existing recurrent VAE models have difficulty modeling sequences with long-term
  structure. To address this issue, we propose the use of a hierarchical decoder,
  which first outputs embeddings for subsequences of the input and then uses these
  embeddings to generate each subsequence independently. This structure encourages
  the model to utilize its latent code, thereby avoiding the "posterior collapse"
  problem which remains an issue for recurrent VAEs. We apply this architecture to
  modeling sequences of musical notes and find that it exhibits dramatically better
  sampling, interpolation, and reconstruction performance than a "flat" baseline model.
  An implementation of our "MusicVAE" is available online at https://goo.gl/magenta/musicvae-code.
