abstract: The k-core decomposition is a fundamental primitive in many machine learning
  and data mining applications. We present the first distributed and the first streaming
  algorithms to compute and maintain an approximate k-core decomposition with provable
  guarantees. Our algorithms achieve rigorous bounds on space complexity while bounding
  the number of passes or number of rounds of computation. We do so by presenting
  a new powerful sketching technique for k-core decomposition, and then by showing
  it can be computed efficiently in both streaming and MapReduce models. Finally,
  we confirm the effectiveness of our sketching technique empirically on a number
  of publicly available graphs.
