abstract: In inductive transfer learning, fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional networks
  substantially outperforms training from scratch.When using fine-tuning, the underlying
  assumption is that the pre-trained model extracts generic features, which are at
  least partially relevant for solving the target task, but would be difficult to
  extract from the limited amount of data available on the target task.However, besides
  the initialization with the pre-trained model and the early stopping, there is no
  mechanism in fine-tuning for retaining the features learned on the source task.In
  this paper, we investigate several regularization schemes that explicitly promote
  the similarity of the final solution with the initial model.We show the benefit
  of having an explicit inductive bias towards the initial model, and we eventually
  recommend a simple $L^2$ penalty with the pre-trained model being a reference as
  the baseline of penalty for transfer learning tasks.
