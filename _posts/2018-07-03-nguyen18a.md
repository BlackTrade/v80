abstract: We analyze the loss landscape and expressiveness of practical deep convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) with shared weights and max pooling layers. We show that
  such CNNs produce linearly independent features at a “wide” layer which has more
  neurons than the number of training samples. This condition holds e.g. for the VGG
  network. Furthermore, we provide for such wide CNNs necessary and sufficient conditions
  for global minima with zero training error. For the case where the wide layer is
  followed by a fully connected layer we show that almost every critical point of
  the empirical loss is a global minimum with zero training error. Our analysis suggests
  that both depth and width are very important in deep learning. While depth brings
  more representational power and allows the network to learn high level features,
  width smoothes the optimization landscape of the loss function in the sense that
  a sufficiently wide network has a well-behaved loss surface with almost no bad local
  minima.
