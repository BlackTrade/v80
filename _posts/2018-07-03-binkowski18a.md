abstract: 'We propose Significance-Offset Convolutional Neural Network, a deep convolutional
  network architecture for regression of multivariate asynchronous time series. The
  model is inspired by standard autoregressive (AR) models and gating mechanisms used
  in recurrent neural networks. It involves an AR-like weighting system, where the
  final predictor is obtained as a weighted sum of adjusted regressors, while the
  weights are data-dependent functions learnt through a convolutional network. The
  architecture was designed for applications on asynchronous time series and is evaluated
  on such datasets: a hedge fund proprietary dataset of over 2 million quotes for
  a credit derivative index, an artificially generated noisy autoregressive series
  and UCI household electricity consumption dataset. The proposed architecture achieves
  promising results as compared to convolutional and recurrent neural networks.'
