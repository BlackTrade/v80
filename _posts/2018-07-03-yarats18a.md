abstract: End-to-end models for goal-orientated dialogue are challenging to train,
  because linguistic and strategic aspects are entangled in latent state vectors.
  We introduce an approach to learning representations of messages in dialogues by
  maximizing the likelihood of subsequent sentences and actions, which decouples the
  semantics of the dialogue utterance from its linguistic realization.We then use
  these latent sentence representations for hierarchical language generation, planning
  and reinforcement learning. Experiments show that our approach increases the end-task
  reward achieved by the model, improves the effectiveness of long-term planning using
  rollouts, and allows self-play reinforcement learning to improve decision making
  without diverging from human language. Our hierarchical latent-variable model outperforms
  previous work both linguistically and strategically.
