abstract: Gradient coding is a technique for straggler mitigation in distributed learning.
  In this paper we design novel gradient codes using tools from classical coding theory,
  namely, cyclic MDS codes, which compare favourably with existing solutions, both
  in the applicable range of parameters and in the complexity of the involved algorithms.
  Second, we introduce an approximate variant of the gradient coding problem, in which
  we settle for approximate gradient computation instead of the exact one. This approach
  enables graceful degradation, i.e., the $\ell_2$ error of the approximate gradient
  is a decreasing function of the number of stragglers. Our main result is that the
  normalized adjacency matrix of an expander graph can yield excellent approximate
  gradient codes, and that this approach allows us to perform significantly less computation
  compared to exact gradient coding. We experimentally test our approach on Amazon
  EC2, and show that the generalization error of approximate gradient coding is very
  close to the full gradient while requiring significantly less computation from the
  workers.
