abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning an one-hidden-layer neural network
  with non-overlapping convolutional layer and ReLU activation function, i.e., $f(Z;
  w, a) = \sum_j a_jσ(w^⊤Z_j)$, in which both the convolutional weights $w$ and the
  output weights $a$ are parameters to be learned. We prove that with Gaussian input
  $\mathbf{Z}$ there is a spurious local minimizer. Surprisingly, in the presence
  of the spurious local minimizer, starting from randomly initialized weights, gradient
  descent with weight normalization can still be proven to recover the true parameters
  with constant probability (which can be boosted to probability $1$ with multiple
  restarts). We also show that with constant probability, the same procedure could
  also converge to the spurious local minimum, showing that the local minimum plays
  a non-trivial role in the dynamics of gradient descent. Furthermore, a quantitative
  analysis shows that the gradient descent dynamics has two phases: it starts off
  slow, but converges much faster after several iterations.'
