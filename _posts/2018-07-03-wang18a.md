abstract: We study the application of the Thompson sampling (TS) methodology to the
  stochastic combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework. We analyze the standard
  TS algorithm for the general CMAB, and obtain the first distribution-dependent regret
  bound of $O(m\log T / \Delta_{\min}) $ for TS under general CMAB, where $m$ is the
  number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\Delta_{\min}$ is the minimum gap
  between the expected reward of the optimal solution and any non-optimal solution.
  We also show that one cannot use an approximate oracle in TS algorithm for even
  MAB problems. Then we expand the analysis to matroid bandit, a special case of CMAB
  and for which we could remove the independence assumption across arms and achieve
  a better regret bound. Finally, we use some experiments to show the comparison of
  regrets of CUCB and CTS algorithms.
