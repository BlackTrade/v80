abstract: This paper proposes a method for multi-class classification problems, where
  the number of classes K is large. The method, referred to as Candidates vs. Noises
  Estimation (CANE), selects a small subset of candidate classes and samples the remaining
  classes. We show that CANE is always consistent and computationally efficient. Moreover,
  the resulting estimator has low statistical variance approaching that of the maximum
  likelihood estimator, when the observed label belongs to the selected candidates
  with high probability. In practice, we use a tree structure with leaves as classes
  to promote fast beam search for candidate selection. We further apply the CANE method
  to estimate word probabilities in learning large neural language models. Extensive
  experimental results show that CANE achieves better prediction accuracy over the
  Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE), its variants and a number of the state-of-the-art
  tree classifiers, while it gains significant speedup compared to standard O(K) methods.
