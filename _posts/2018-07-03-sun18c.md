abstract: We consider the problem of learning high-dimensional Gaussian graphical
  models. The graphical lasso is one of the most popular methods for estimating Gaussian
  graphical models. However, it does not achieve the oracle rate of convergence. In
  this paper, we propose the graphical nonconvex optimization for optimal estimation
  in Gaussian graphical models, which is then approximated by a sequence of convex
  programs. Our proposal is computationally tractable and produces an estimator that
  achieves the oracle rate of convergence. The statistical error introduced by the
  sequential approximation using a sequence of convex programs is clearly demonstrated
  via a contraction property. The proposed methodology is then extended to modeling
  semiparametric graphical models. We show via numerical studies that the proposed
  estimator outperforms other popular methods for estimating Gaussian graphical models.
