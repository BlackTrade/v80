abstract: Microbes are everywhere, including in and on our bodies, and have been shown
  to play key roles in a variety of prevalent human diseases. Consequently, there
  has been intense interest in the design of bacteriotherapies or "bugs as drugs,"
  which are communities of bacteria administered to patients for specific therapeutic
  applications. Central to the design of such therapeutics is an understanding of
  the causal microbial interaction network and the population dynamics of the organisms.
  In this work we present a Bayesian nonparametric model and associated efficient
  inference algorithm that addresses the key conceptual and practical challenges of
  learning microbial dynamics from time series microbe abundance data. These challenges
  include high-dimensional (300+ strains of bacteria in the gut) but temporally sparse
  and non-uniformly sampled data; high measurement noise; and, nonlinear and physically
  non-negative dynamics. Our contributions include a new type of dynamical systems
  model for microbial dynamics based on what we term interaction modules, or learned
  clusters of latent variables with redundant interaction structure (reducing the
  expected number of interaction coefficients from O(n^2) to O((log n)^2)); a fully
  Bayesian formulation of the stochastic dynamical systems model that propagates measurement
  and latent state uncertainty throughout the model; and introduction of a temporally
  varying auxiliary variable technique to enable efficient inference by relaxing the
  hard non-negativity constraint on states. We apply our method to simulated and real
  data, and demonstrate the utility of our technique for system identification from
  limited data and gaining new biological insights into bacteriotherapy design.
