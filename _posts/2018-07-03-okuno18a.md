abstract: A simple framework Probabilistic Multi-view Graph Embedding (PMvGE) is proposed
  for multi-view feature learning with many-to-many associations so that it generalizes
  various existing multi-view methods. PMvGE is a probabilistic model for predicting
  new associations via graph embedding of the nodes of data vectors with links of
  their associations. Multi-view data vectors with many-to-many associations are transformed
  by neural networks to feature vectors in a shared space, and the probability of
  new association between two data vectors is modeled by the inner product of their
  feature vectors. While existing multi-view feature learning techniques can treat
  only either of many-to-many association or non-linear transformation, PMvGE can
  treat both simultaneously. By combining Mercerâ€™s theorem and the universal approximation
  theorem, we prove that PMvGE learns a wide class of similarity measures across views.
  Our likelihood-based estimator enables efficient computation of non-linear transformations
  of data vectors in large-scale datasets by minibatch SGD, and numerical experiments
  illustrate that PMvGE outperforms existing multi-view methods.
