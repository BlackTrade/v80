abstract: 'In this paper, we revisit the recurrent back-propagation (RBP) algorithm,
  discuss the conditions under which it applies as well as how to satisfy them in
  deep neural networks. We show that RBP can be unstable and propose two variants
  based on conjugate gradient on the normal equations (CG-RBP) and Neumann series
  (Neumann-RBP). We further investigate the relationship between Neumann-RBP and back
  propagation through time (BPTT) and its truncated version (TBPTT). Our Neumann-RBP
  has the same time complexity as TBPTT but only requires constant memory, whereas
  TBPTTâ€™s memory cost scales linearly with the number of truncation steps. We examine
  all RBP variants along with BPTT and TBPTT in three different application domains:
  associative memory with continuous Hopfield networks, document classification in
  citation networks using graph neural networks and hyperparameter optimization for
  fully connected networks. All experiments demonstrate that RBPs, especially the
  Neumann-RBP variant, are efficient and effective for optimizing convergent recurrent
  neural networks.'
