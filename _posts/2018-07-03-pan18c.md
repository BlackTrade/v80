abstract: Recently, a unified model for image-to-image translation tasks within adversarial
  learning framework has aroused widespread research interests in computer vision
  practitioners. Their reported empirical success however lacks solid theoretical
  interpretations for its inherent mechanism. In this paper, we reformulate their
  model from a brand-new geometrical perspective and have eventually reached a full
  interpretation on some interesting but unclear empirical phenomenons from their
  experiments. Furthermore, by extending the definition of generalization for generative
  adversarial nets to a broader sense, we have derived a condition to control the
  generalization capability of their model. According to our derived condition, several
  practical suggestions have also been proposed on model design and dataset construction
  as a guidance for further empirical researches.
