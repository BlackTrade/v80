abstract: We propose a method to learn deep ReLU-based classifiers that are provably
  robust against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations on the training data. For
  previously unseen examples, the approach is guaranteed to detect all adversarial
  examples, though it may flag some non-adversarial examples as well. The basic idea
  is to consider a convex outer approximation of the set of activations reachable
  through a norm-bounded perturbation, and we develop a robust optimization procedure
  that minimizes the worst case loss over this outer region (via a linear program).
  Crucially, we show that the dual problem to this linear program can be represented
  itself as a deep network similar to the backpropagation network, leading to very
  efficient optimization approaches that produce guaranteed bounds on the robust loss.
  The end result is that by executing a few more forward and backward passes through
  a slightly modified version of the original network (though possibly with much larger
  batch sizes), we can learn a classifier that is provably robust to any norm-bounded
  adversarial attack. We illustrate the approach on a number of tasks to train classifiers
  with robust adversarial guarantees (e.g. for MNIST, we produce a convolutional classifier
  that provably has less than 5.8% test error for any adversarial attack with bounded
  $\ell_\infty$ norm less than $\epsilon = 0.1$).
