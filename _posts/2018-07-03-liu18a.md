abstract: In order to scale standard Gaussian process (GP) regression to large-scale
  datasets, aggregation models employ factorized training process and then combine
  predictions from distributed experts. The state-of-the-art aggregation models, however,
  either provide inconsistent predictions or require time-consuming aggregation process.
  We first prove the inconsistency of typical aggregations using disjoint or random
  data partition, and then present a consistent yet efficient aggregation model for
  large-scale GP. The proposed model inherits the advantages of aggregations, e.g.,
  closed-form inference and aggregation, parallelization and distributed computing.
  Furthermore, theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that the new aggregation
  model performs better due to the consistent predictions that converge to the true
  underlying function when the training size approaches infinity.
