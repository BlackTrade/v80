abstract: We address the problem of detecting distribution changes in multivariate
  data streams by means of histograms. Histograms are very general and flexible models,
  which have been relatively ignored in the change-detection literature as they often
  require a number of bins that grows unfeasibly with the data dimension. We present
  QuantTree, a recursive binary splitting scheme that adaptively defines the histogram
  bins to ease the detection of any distribution change. Our design scheme implies
  that i) we can easily control the overall number of bins and ii) the bin probabilities
  do not depend on the distribution of stationary data. This latter is a very relevant
  aspect in change detection, since thresholds of tests statistics based on these
  histograms (e.g., the Pearson statistic or the total variation) can be numerically
  computed from univariate and synthetically generated data, yet guaranteeing a controlled
  false positive rate. Our experiments show that the proposed histograms are very
  effective in detecting changes in high dimensional data streams, and that the resulting
  thresholds can effectively control the false positive rate, even when the number
  of training samples is relatively small.
