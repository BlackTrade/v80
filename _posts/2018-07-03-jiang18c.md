abstract: Recent deep networks are capable of memorizing the entire data even when
  the labels are completely random. To overcome the overfitting on corrupted labels,
  we propose a novel technique of learning another neural network, called MentorNet,
  to supervise the training of the base deep networks, namely, StudentNet. During
  training, MentorNet provides a curriculum (sample weighting scheme) for StudentNet
  to focus on the sample the label of which is probably correct. Unlike the existing
  curriculum that is usually predefined by human experts, MentorNet learns a data-driven
  curriculum dynamically with StudentNet. Experimental results demonstrate that our
  approach can significantly improve the generalization performance of deep networks
  trained on corrupted training data. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we achieve
  the best-published result on WebVision, a large benchmark containing 2.2 million
  images of real-world noisy labels.
