abstract: We propose a new statistical model for ranking data, i.e., a new family
  of probability distributions on permutations. Our model is inspired by the idea
  of a data-generating process in the form of a noisy sorting procedure, in which
  deterministic comparisons between pairs of items are replaced by Bernoulli trials.
  The probability of producing a certain ranking as a result then essentially depends
  on the Bernoulli parameters, which can be interpreted as pairwise preferences. We
  show that our model can be written in closed form if insertion or quick sort are
  used as sorting algorithms, and propose a maximum likelihood approach for parameter
  estimation. We also introduce a generalization of the model, in which the constraints
  on pairwise preferences are relaxed, and for which maximum likelihood estimation
  can be carried out based on a variation of the generalized iterative scaling algorithm.
  Experimentally, we show that the models perform very well in terms of goodness of
  fit, compared to existing models for ranking data.
