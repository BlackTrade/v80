abstract: Non-convex optimization problems arise frequently in machine learning, including
  feature selection, structured matrix learning, mixture modeling, and neural network
  training. We consider the problem of finding critical points of a broad class of
  non-convex problems with non-smooth components. We analyze the behavior of two gradient-based
  methodsâ€”namely a sub-gradient method, and a proximal method. Our main results are
  to establish rates of convergence for general problems, and also exhibit faster
  rates for sub-analytic functions. As an application of our theory, we obtain a simplification
  of the popular CCCP algorithm, which retains all the desirable convergence properties
  of the original method, along with a significantly lower cost per iteration. We
  illustrate our methods and theory via application to the problems of best subset
  selection, robust estimation, and shape from shading reconstruction.
