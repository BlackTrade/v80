abstract: Tree search algorithms, such as branch-and-bound, are the most widely used
  tools for solving combinatorial problems. These algorithms recursively partition
  the search space to find an optimal solution. To keep the tree small, it is crucial
  to carefully decide, when expanding a tree node, which variable to branch on at
  that node to partition the remaining space. Many partitioning techniques have been
  proposed, but no theory describes which is optimal. We show how to use machine learning
  to determine an optimal weighting of any set of partitioning procedures for the
  instance distribution at hand using samples. Via theory and experiments, we show
  that learning to branch is both practical and hugely beneficial.
