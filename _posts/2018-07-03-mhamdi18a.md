abstract: 'While machine learning is going through an era of celebrated success,concerns
  have been raised about the vulnerability of its backbone: stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD).Recent approaches have been proposed to ensure the robustness of distributed
  SGD against adversarial (Byzantine) workers sending <em>poisoned</em> gradients
  during the training phase.Some of these approaches have been proven <em>Byzantine–resilient</em>:
  they ensure the <em>convergence</em> of SGD despite the presence of a minority of
  adversarial workers.We show in this paper that <em>convergence is not enough</em>.In
  high dimension $d ≫1$,an adver\-sary can build on the loss function’s non–convexity
  to make SGD converge to <em>ineffective</em> models.More precisely, we bring to
  light that existing Byzantine–resilient schemes leave a <em>margin of poisoning</em>
  of $\bigOmega\left(f(d)\right)$,where $f(d)$ increases at least like $\sqrt[p]{d }$.Based
  on this <em>leeway</em>, we build a simple attack,and experimentally show its strong
  to utmost effectivity on CIFAR–10 and MNIST.We introduce <em>Bulyan</em>, and prove
  it significantly reduces the attackers leeway to a narrow $\bigO\,( \sfrac{1}{\sqrt{d }})$
  bound.We empirically show that Bulyan does not suffer the fragility of existing
  aggregation rules and,at a reasonable cost in terms of required batch size,achieves
  convergence <em>as if</em> only non–Byzantine gradients had been used to update
  the model.'
