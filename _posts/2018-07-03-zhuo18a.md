abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a recently proposed particle-based
  Bayesian inference method, which has attracted a lot of interest due to its remarkable
  approximation ability and particle efficiency compared to traditional variational
  inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. However, we observed that particles
  of SVGD tend to collapse to modes of the target distribution, and this particle
  degeneracy phenomenon becomes more severe with higher dimensions. Our theoretical
  analysis finds out that there exists a negative correlation between the dimensionality
  and the repulsive force of SVGD which should be blamed for this phenomenon. We propose
  Message Passing SVGD (MP-SVGD) to solve this problem. By leveraging the conditional
  independence structure of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), MP-SVGD converts
  the original high-dimensional global inference problem into a set of local ones
  over the Markov blanket with lower dimensions. Experimental results show its advantages
  of preventing vanishing repulsive force in high-dimensional space over SVGD, and
  its particle efficiency and approximation flexibility over other inference methods
  on graphical models.
