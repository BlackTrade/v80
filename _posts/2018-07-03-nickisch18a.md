abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview and tooling for GP modelling with non-Gaussian
  likelihoods using state space methods. The state space formulation allows for solving
  one-dimensonal GP models in O(n) time and memory complexity. While existing literature
  has focused on the connection between GP regression and state space methods, the
  computational primitives allowing for inference using general likelihoods in combination
  with the Laplace approximation (LA), variational Bayes (VB), and assumed density
  filtering (ADF) / expectation propagation (EP) schemes has been largely overlooked.
  We present means of combining the efficient O(n) state space methodology with existing
  inference methods. We also furher extend existing methods, and provide unifying
  code implementing all approaches.
