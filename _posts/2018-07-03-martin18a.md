abstract: Spectral clustering is a widely studied problem, yet its complexity is prohibitive
  for dynamic graphs of even modest size. We claim that it is possible to reuse information
  of past cluster assignments to expedite computation. Our approach builds on a recent
  idea of sidestepping the main bottleneck of spectral clustering, i.e., computing
  the graph eigenvectors, by a polynomial-based randomized sketching technique. We
  show that the proposed algorithm achieves clustering assignments with quality approximating
  that of spectral clustering and that it can yield significant complexity benefits
  when the graph dynamics are appropriately bounded. In our experiments, our method
  clusters 30k node graphs 3.9$\times$ faster in average and deviates from the correct
  assignment by less than 0.1%.
