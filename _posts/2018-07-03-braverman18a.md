abstract: 'A central problem in mining massive data streams is characterizing which
  functions of an underlying frequency vector can be approximated efficiently. Given
  the prevalence of large scale linear algebra problems in machine learning, recently
  there has been considerable effort in extending this data stream problem to that
  of estimating functions of a matrix. This setting generalizes classical problems
  to the analogous ones for matrices. For example, instead of estimating frequent-item
  counts, we now wish to estimate “frequent-direction” counts. A related example is
  to estimate norms, which now correspond to estimating a vector norm on the singular
  values of the matrix. Despite recent efforts, the current understanding for such
  matrix problems is considerably weaker than that for vector problems. We study a
  number of aspects of estimating matrix norms in a stream that have not previously
  been considered: (1) multi-pass algorithms, (2) algorithms that see the underlying
  matrix one row at a time, and (3) time-efficient algorithms. Our multi-pass and
  row-order algorithms use less memory than what is provably required in the single-pass
  and entrywise-update models, and thus give separations between these models (in
  terms of memory).Moreover, all of our algorithms are considerably faster than previous
  ones. We also prove a number of lower bounds, and obtain for instance, a near-complete
  characterization of the memory requiredof row-order algorithms for estimating Schatten
  $p$-norms of sparse matrices.We complement our results with numerical experiments.'
