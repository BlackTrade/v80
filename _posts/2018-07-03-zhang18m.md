abstract: We propose a primal-dual based framework for analyzing the global optimality
  of nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery. Our analysis are based on the restricted
  strongly convex and smooth conditions, which can be verified for a broad family
  of loss functions. In addition, our analytic framework can directly handle the widely-used
  incoherence constraints through the lens of duality. We illustrate the applicability
  of the proposed framework to matrix completion and one-bit matrix completion, and
  prove that all these problems have no spurious local minima. Our results not only
  improve the sample complexity required for characterizing the global optimality
  of matrix completion, but also resolve an open problem in Ge et al. (2017) regarding
  one-bit matrix completion. Numerical experiments show that primal-dual based algorithm
  can successfully recover the global optimum for various low-rank problems.
