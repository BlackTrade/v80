abstract: The unfairness of a regressor is evaluated by measuring the correlation
  between the estimator and the sensitive attribute (e.g., race, gender, age), and
  the coefficient of determination (CoD) is a natural extension of the correlation
  coefficient when more than one sensitive attribute exists. As is well known, there
  is a trade-off between fairness and accuracy of a regressor, which implies a perfectly
  fair optimizer does not always yield a useful prediction. Taking this into consideration,
  we optimize the accuracy of the estimation subject to a user-defined level of fairness.
  However, a fairness level as a constraint induces a nonconvexity of the feasible
  region, which disables the use of an off-the-shelf convex optimizer. Despite such
  nonconvexity, we show an exact solution is available by using tools of global optimization
  theory. Furthermore, we propose a nonlinear extension of the method by kernel representation.
  Unlike most of existing fairness-aware machine learning methods, our method allows
  us to deal with numeric and multiple sensitive attributes.
