abstract: Submodular functions are a broad class of set functions that naturally arise
  in many machine learning applications. Due to their combinatorial structures, there
  has been a myriad of algorithms for maximizing such functions under various constraints.
  Unfortunately, once a function deviates from submodularity (even slightly), the
  known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending this issue, by obtaining
  approximation results for functions obeying properties that generalize submodularity,
  has been the focus of several recent works. One such class, known as weakly submodular
  functions, has received a lot of recent attention from the machine learning community
  due to its strong connections to restricted strong convexity and sparse reconstruction.
  In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm achieves
  an approximation ratio of $(1 + 1/γ)^{-2}$ for weakly submodular maximization subject
  to a general matroid constraint, where $γ$ is a parameter measuring the distance
  from submodularity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with
  a non-trivial approximation guarantee for this constrained optimization problem.
  Moreover, our experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs well
  in a variety of real-world problems, including regression, video summarization,
  splice site detection, and black-box interpretation.
