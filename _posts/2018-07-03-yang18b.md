abstract: A probabilistic framework based on the covariate-dependent relational gamma
  process is developed to analyze relational data arising from longitudinal networks.
  The proposed framework characterizes networked nodes by nonnegative node-group memberships,
  which allow each node to belong to multiple latent groups simultaneously, and encodes
  edge probabilities between each pair of nodes using a Bernoulli Poisson link to
  the embedded latent space. Within the latent space, our framework models the birth
  and death dynamics of individual groups via a thinning function. Our framework also
  captures the evolution of individual node-group memberships over time using gamma
  Markov processes. Exploiting the recent advances in data augmentation and marginalization
  techniques, a simple and efficient Gibbs sampler is proposed for posterior computation.
  Experimental results on a simulation study and three real-world temporal network
  data sets demonstrate the modelâ€™s capability, competitive performance and scalability
  compared to state-of-the-art methods.
