abstract: 'Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning methods are limited typically
  to a small number of agents. When the agent number increases largely, the learning
  becomes intractable due to the curse of the dimensionality and the exponential growth
  of agent interactions. In this paper, we present Mean Field Reinforcement Learning
  where the interactions within the population of agents are approximated by those
  between a single agent and the average effect from the overall population or neighboring
  agents; the interplay between the two entities is mutually reinforced: the learning
  of the individual agentâ€™s optimal policy depends on the dynamics of the population,
  while the dynamics of the population change according to the collective patterns
  of the individual policies. We develop practical mean field Q-learning and mean
  field Actor-Critic algorithms and analyze the convergence of the solution to Nash
  equilibrium. Experiments on Gaussian squeeze, Ising model, and battle games justify
  the learning effectiveness of our mean field approaches. In addition, we report
  the first result to solve the Ising model via model-free reinforcement learning
  methods.'
