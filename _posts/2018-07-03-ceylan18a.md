abstract: Many parametric statistical models are not properly normalised and only
  specified up to an intractable partition function, which renders parameter estimation
  difficult. Examples of unnormalised models are Gibbs distributions, Markov random
  fields, and neural network models in unsupervised deep learning. In previous work,
  the estimation principle called noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) was introduced
  where unnormalised models are estimated by learning to distinguish between data
  and auxiliary noise. An open question is how to best choose the auxiliary noise
  distribution. We here propose a new method that addresses this issue. The proposed
  method shares with NCE the idea of formulating density estimation as a supervised
  learning problem but in contrast to NCE, the proposed method leverages the observed
  data when generating noise samples. The noise can thus be generated in a semi-automated
  manner. We first present the underlying theory of the new method, show that score
  matching emerges as a limiting case, validate the method on continuous and discrete
  valued synthetic data, and show that we can expect an improved performance compared
  to NCE when the data lie in a lower-dimensional manifold. Then we demonstrate its
  applicability in unsupervised deep learning by estimating a four-layer neural image
  model.
