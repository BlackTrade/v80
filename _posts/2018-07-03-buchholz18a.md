abstract: Many machine learning problems involve MonteCarlo gradient estimators. As
  a prominent example, we focus on Monte Carlo variational inference (MCVI) in this
  paper. The performanceof MCVI crucially depends on the variance of itsstochastic
  gradients. We propose variance reduction by means of Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling.
  QMC replaces N i.i.d. samples from a uniform probability distribution by a deterministicsequence
  of samples of length N. This sequencecovers the underlying random variable space
  moreevenly than i.i.d. draws, reducing the variance ofthe gradient estimator. With
  our novel approach,both the score function and the reparameterization gradient estimators
  lead to much faster convergence. We also propose a new algorithm forMonte Carlo
  objectives, where we operate witha constant learning rate and increase the numberof
  QMC samples per iteration. We prove that thisway, our algorithm can converge asymptoticallyat
  a faster rate than SGD . We furthermore providetheoretical guarantees on qmc for
  Monte Carloobjectives that go beyond MCVI , and support ourfindings by several experiments
  on large-scaledata sets from various domains.
