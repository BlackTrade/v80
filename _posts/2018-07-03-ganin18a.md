abstract: Advances in deep generative networks have led to impressive results in recent
  years. Nevertheless, such models can often waste their capacity on the minutiae
  of datasets, presumably due to weak inductive biases in their decoders. This is
  where graphics engines may come in handy since they abstract away low-level details
  and represent images as high-level programs. Current methods that combine deep learning
  and renderers are limited by hand-crafted likelihood or distance functions, a need
  for large amounts of supervision, or difficulties in scaling their inference algorithms
  to richer datasets. To mitigate these issues, we present SPIRAL, an adversarially
  trained agent that generates a program which is executed by a graphics engine to
  interpret and sample images. The goal of this agent is to fool a discriminator network
  that distinguishes between real and rendered data, trained with a distributed reinforcement
  learning setup without any supervision. A surprising finding is that using the discriminatorâ€™s
  output as a reward signal is the key to allow the agent to make meaningful progress
  at matching the desired output rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is
  the first demonstration of an end-to-end, unsupervised and adversarial inverse graphics
  agent on challenging real world (MNIST, Omniglot, CelebA) and synthetic 3D datasets.
