abstract: To cope with changing environments, recent developments in online learning
  have introduced the concepts of adaptive regret and dynamic regret independently.
  In this paper, we illustrate an intrinsic connection between these two concepts
  by showing that the dynamic regret can be expressed in terms of the adaptive regret
  and the functional variation. This observation implies that strongly adaptive algorithms
  can be directly leveraged to minimize the dynamic regret. As a result, we present
  a series of strongly adaptive algorithms that have small dynamic regrets for convex
  functions, exponentially concave functions, and strongly convex functions, respectively.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that exponential concavity
  is utilized to upper bound the dynamic regret. Moreover, all of those adaptive algorithms
  do not need any prior knowledge of the functional variation, which is a significant
  advantage over previous specialized methods for minimizing dynamic regret.
