abstract: We seek to automate the design of molecules based on specific chemical properties.
  In computational terms, this task involves continuous embedding and generation of
  molecular graphs. Our primary contribution is the direct realization of molecular
  graphs, a task previously approached by generating linear SMILES strings instead
  of graphs. Our junction tree variational autoencoder generates molecular graphs
  in two phases, by first generating a tree-structured scaffold over chemical substructures,
  and then combining them into a molecule with a graph message passing network. This
  approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical
  validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular
  generation to optimization. Across these tasks, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
  baselines by a significant margin.
