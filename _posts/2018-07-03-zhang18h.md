abstract: It is a known fact that training recurrent neural networks for tasks that
  have long term dependencies is challenging. One of the main reasons is the vanishing
  or exploding gradient problem, which prevents gradient information from propagating
  to early layers. In this paper we propose a simple recurrent architecture, the Fourier
  Recurrent Unit (FRU), that stabilizes the gradients that arise in its training while
  giving us stronger expressive power. Specifically, FRU summarizes the hidden states
  $h^{(t)}$ along the temporal dimension with Fourier basis functions. This allows
  gradients to easily reach any layer due to FRUâ€™s residual learning structure and
  the global support of trigonometric functions. We show that FRU has gradient lower
  and upper bounds independent of temporal dimension. We also show the strong expressivity
  of sparse Fourier basis, from which FRU obtains its strong expressive power. Our
  experimental study also demonstrates that with fewer parameters the proposed architecture
  outperforms other recurrent architectures on many tasks.
