abstract: Work on approximate linear algebra has led to efficient distributed and
  streaming algorithms for problems such as approximate matrix multiplication, low
  rank approximation, and regression, primarily for the Euclidean norm $\ell_2$. We
  study other $\ell_p$ norms, which are more robust for $p < 2$, and can be used to
  find outliers for $p > 2$. Unlike previous algorithms for such norms, we give algorithms
  that are (1) deterministic, (2) work simultaneously for every $p \geq 1$, including
  $p = \infty$, and (3) can be implemented in both distributed and streaming environments.
  We study $\ell_p$-regression, entrywise $\ell_p$-low rank approximation, and versions
  of approximate matrix multiplication.
