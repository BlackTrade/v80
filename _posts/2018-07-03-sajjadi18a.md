abstract: 'Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been shown to produce realistic
  samples from high-dimensional distributions, but training them is considered hard.
  A possible explanation for training instabilities is the inherent imbalance between
  the networks: While the discriminator is trained directly on both real and fake
  samples, the generator only has control over the fake samples it produces since
  the real data distribution is fixed by the choice of a given dataset. We propose
  a simple modification that gives the generator control over the real samples which
  leads to a tempered learning process for both generator and discriminator. The real
  data distribution passes through a lens before being revealed to the discriminator,
  balancing the generator and discriminator by gradually revealing more detailed features
  necessary to produce high-quality results. The proposed module automatically adjusts
  the learning process to the current strength of the networks, yet is generic and
  easy to add to any GAN variant. In a number of experiments, we show that this can
  improve quality, stability and/or convergence speed across a range of different
  GAN architectures (DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP).'
