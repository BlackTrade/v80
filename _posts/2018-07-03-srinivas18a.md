abstract: Classical distillation methods transfer representations from a “teacher”
  neural network to a “student” network by matching their output activations. Recent
  methods also match the Jacobians, or the gradient of output activations with the
  input. However, this involves making some ad hoc decisions, in particular, the choice
  of the loss function. In this paper, we first establish an equivalence between Jacobian
  matching and distillation with input noise, from which we derive appropriate loss
  functions for Jacobian matching. We then rely on this analysis to apply Jacobian
  matching to transfer learning by establishing equivalence of a recent transfer learning
  procedure to distillation. We then show experimentally on standard image datasets
  that Jacobian-based penalties improve distillation, robustness to noisy inputs,
  and transfer learning.
