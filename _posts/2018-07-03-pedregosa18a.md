abstract: We propose and analyze a novel adaptive step size variant of the Davis-Yin
  three operator splitting, a method that can solve optimization problems composed
  of a sum of a smooth term for which we have access to its gradient and an arbitrary
  number of potentially non-smooth terms for which we have access to their proximal
  operator. The proposed method leverages local information of the objective function,
  allowing for larger step sizes while preserving the convergence properties of the
  original method. It only requires two extra function evaluations per iteration and
  does not depend on any step size hyperparameter besides an initial estimate. We
  provide a convergence rate analysis of this method, showing sublinear convergence
  rate for general convex functions and linear convergence under stronger assumptions,
  matching the best known rates of its non adaptive variant. Finally, an empirical
  comparison with related methods on 6 different problems illustrates the computational
  advantage of the adaptive step size strategy.
