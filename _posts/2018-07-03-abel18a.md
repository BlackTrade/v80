abstract: 'In lifelong reinforcement learning, agents must effectively transfer knowledge
  across tasks while simultaneously addressing exploration, credit assignment, and
  generalization. State abstraction can help overcome these hurdles by compressing
  the representation used by an agent, thereby reducing the computational and statistical
  burdens of learning. To this end, we here develop theory to compute and use state
  abstractions in lifelong reinforcement learning. We introduce two new classes of
  abstractions: (1) transitive state abstractions, whose optimal form can be computed
  efficiently, and (2) PAC state abstractions, which are guaranteed to hold with respect
  to a distribution of tasks. We show that the joint family of transitive PAC abstractions
  can be acquired efficiently, preserve near optimal-behavior, and experimentally
  reduce sample complexity in simple domains, thereby yielding a family of desirable
  abstractions for use in lifelong reinforcement learning. Along with these positive
  results, we show that there are pathological cases where state abstractions can
  negatively impact performance.'
