abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique to train an agent to
  perform a task; however, an agent that is trained using RL is only capable of achieving
  the single task that is specified via its reward function. Such an approach does
  not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks,
  such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations.
  Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the
  range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment. We use a generator
  network to propose tasks for the agent to try to accomplish, each task being specified
  as reaching a certain parametrized subset of the state-space. The generator network
  is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the
  appropriate level of difficulty for the agent, thus automatically producing a curriculum.
  We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically
  learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its
  environment, even when only sparse rewards are available. Videos and code available
