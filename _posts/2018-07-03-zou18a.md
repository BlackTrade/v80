abstract: We propose a fast stochastic Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) method, for sampling
  from a smooth and strongly log-concave distribution. At the core of our proposed
  method is a variance reduction technique inspired by the recent advance in stochastic
  optimization. We show that, to achieve $\epsilon$ accuracy in 2-Wasserstein distance,
  our algorithm achieves $\tilde O\big(n+\kappa^{2}d^{1/2}/\epsilon+\kappa^{4/3}d^{1/3}n^{2/3}/\epsilon^{2/3}\big)$
  gradient complexity (i.e., number of component gradient evaluations), which outperforms
  the state-of-the-art HMC and stochastic gradient HMC methods in a wide regime. We
  also extend our algorithm for sampling from smooth and general log-concave distributions,
  and prove the corresponding gradient complexity as well. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real data demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.
