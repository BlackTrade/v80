abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the optimization algorithm of choice
  in many machine learning applications such as regularized empirical risk minimization
  and training deep neural networks. The classical convergence analysis of SGD is
  carried out under the assumption that the norm of the stochastic gradient is uniformly
  bounded. While this might hold for some loss functions, it is always violated for
  cases where the objective function is strongly convex. In (Bottou et al.,2016),
  a new analysis of convergence of SGD is performed under the assumption that stochastic
  gradients are bounded with respect to the true gradient norm. Here we show that
  for stochastic problems arising in machine learningsuch bound always holds; and
  we also propose an alternative convergence analysis of SGD with diminishing learning
  rate regime, which results in more relaxed conditions than those in (Bottou et al.,2016).
  We then move on the asynchronous parallel setting, and prove convergence of Hogwild!
  algorithm in the same regime, obtaining the first convergence results for this method
  in the case of diminished learning rate.
