abstract: A parametric point process model is developed, with modeling based on the
  assumption that sequential observations often share latent phenomena, while also
  possessing idiosyncratic effects. An alternating optimization method is proposed
  to learn a “registered” point process that accounts for shared structure, as well
  as “warping” functions that characterize idiosyncratic aspects of each observed
  sequence. Under reasonable constraints, in each iteration we update the sample-specific
  warping functions by solving a set of constrained nonlinear programming problems
  in parallel, and update the model by maximum likelihood estimation. The justifiability,
  complexity and robustness of the proposed method are investigated in detail, and
  the influence of sequence stitching on the learning results is examined empirically.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the method yields
  explainable point process models, achieving encouraging results compared to state-of-the-art
  methods.
