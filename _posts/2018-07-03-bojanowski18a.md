abstract: 'Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable results
  in the task of generating realistic natural images. In most successful applications,
  GAN models share two common aspects: solving a challenging saddle point optimization
  problem, interpreted as an adversarial game between a generator and a discriminator
  functions; and parameterizing the generator and the discriminator as deep convolutional
  neural networks. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of these
  two factors to the success of GANs. In particular, we introduce Generative Latent
  Optimization (GLO), a framework to train deep convolutional generators using simple
  reconstruction losses. Throughout a variety of experiments, we show that GLO enjoys
  many of the desirable properties of GANs: synthesizing visually-appealing samples,
  interpolating meaningfully between samples, and performing linear arithmetic with
  noise vectors; all of this without the adversarial optimization scheme.'
