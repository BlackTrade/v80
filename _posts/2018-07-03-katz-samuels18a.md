abstract: 'We introduce the feasible arm identification problem, a pure exploration
  multi-armed bandit problem where the agent is given a set of $D$-dimensional arms
  and a polyhedron $P = \{x : A x ≤b \} ⊂R^D$. Pulling an arm gives a random vector
  and the goal is to determine, using a fixed budget of $T$ pulls, which of the arms
  have means belonging to $P$. We propose three algorithms MD-UCBE, MD-SAR, and MD-APT
  and provide a unified analysis establishing upper bounds for each of them. We also
  establish a lower bound that matches up to constants the upper bounds of MD-UCBE
  and MD-APT. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic
  and real-world datasets.'
