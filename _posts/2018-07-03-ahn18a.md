abstract: Probabilistic graphical models are a key tool in machine learning applications.
  Computing the partition function, i.e., normalizing constant, is a fundamental task
  of statistical inference but is generally computationally intractable, leading to
  extensive study of approximation methods. Iterative variational methods are a popular
  and successful family of approaches. However, even state of the art variational
  methods can return poor results or fail to converge on difficult instances. In this
  paper, we instead consider computing the partition function via sequential summation
  over variables. We develop robust approximate algorithms by combining ideas from
  mini-bucket elimination with tensor network and renormalization group methods from
  statistical physics. The resulting “convergence-free” methods show good empirical
  performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmark models, even for difficult
  instances.
