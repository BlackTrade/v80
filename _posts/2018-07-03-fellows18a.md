abstract: We propose a new way of deriving policy gradient updates for reinforcement
  learning. Our technique, based on Fourier analysis, recasts integrals that arise
  with expected policy gradients as convolutions and turns them into multiplications.
  The obtained analytical solutions allow us to capture the low variance benefits
  of EPG in a broad range of settings. For the critic, we treat trigonometric and
  radial basis functions, two function families with the universal approximation property.
  The choice of policy can be almost arbitrary, including mixtures or hybrid continuous-discrete
  probability distributions. Moreover, we derive a general family of sample-based
  estimators for stochastic policy gradients, which unifies existing results on sample-based
  approximation. We believe that this technique has the potential to shape the next
  generation of policy gradient approaches, powered by analytical results.
