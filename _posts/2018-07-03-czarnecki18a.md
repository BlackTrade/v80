abstract: 'We introduce Mix and match (M&M) â€“ a training framework designed to facilitate
  rapid and effective learning in RL agents that would be too slow or too challenging
  to train otherwise.The key innovation is a procedure that allows us to automatically
  form a curriculum over agents. Through such a curriculum we can progressively train
  more complex agents by, effectively, bootstrapping from solutions found by simpler
  agents.In contradistinction to typical curriculum learning approaches, we do not
  gradually modify the tasks or environments presented, but instead use a process
  to gradually alter how the policy is represented internally.We show the broad applicability
  of our method by demonstrating significant performance gains in three different
  experimental setups: (1) We train an agent able to control more than 700 actions
  in a challenging 3D first-person task; using our method to progress through an action-space
  curriculum we achieve both faster training and better final performance than one
  obtains using traditional methods.(2) We further show that M&M can be used successfully
  to progress through a curriculum of architectural variants defining an agents internal
  state. (3) Finally, we illustrate how a variant of our method can be used to improve
  agent performance in a multitask setting.'
