abstract: To assess the difference between real and synthetic data, Generative Adversarial
  Networks (GANs) are trained using a distribution discrepancy measure. Three widely
  employed measures are information-theoretic divergences, integral probability metrics,
  and Hilbert space discrepancy metrics. We elucidate the theoretical connections
  between these three popular GAN training criteria and propose a novel procedure,
  called $\chi^2$ (Chi-square) GAN, that is conceptually simple, stable at training
  and resistant to mode collapse. Our procedure naturally generalizes to address the
  problem of simultaneous matching of multiple distributions. Further, we propose
  a resampling strategy that significantly improves sample quality, by repurposing
  the trained critic function via an importance weighting mechanism. Experiments show
  that the proposed procedure improves stability and convergence, and yields state-of-art
  results on a wide range of generative modeling tasks.
