abstract: In this paper, we advocate for representation learning as the key to mitigating
  unfair prediction outcomes downstream. Motivated by a scenario where learned representations
  are used by third parties with unknown objectives, we propose and explore adversarial
  representation learning as a natural method of ensuring those parties act fairly.
  We connect group fairness (demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity)
  to different adversarial objectives. Through worst-case theoretical guarantees and
  experimental validation, we show that the choice of this objective is crucial to
  fair prediction. Furthermore, we present the first in-depth experimental demonstration
  of fair transfer learning and demonstrate empirically that our learned representations
  admit fair predictions on new tasks while maintaining utility, an essential goal
  of fair representation learning.
