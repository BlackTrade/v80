abstract: 'Distance metric learning (DML), which learns a distance metric from labeled
  "similar" and "dissimilar" data pairs, is widely utilized. Recently, several works
  investigate orthogonality-promoting regularization (OPR), which encourages the projection
  vectors in DML to be close to being orthogonal, to achieve three effects: (1) high
  balancedness – achieving comparable performance on both frequent and infrequent
  classes; (2) high compactness – using a small number of projection vectors to achieve
  a "good" metric; (3) good generalizability – alleviating overfitting to training
  data. While showing promising results, these approaches suffer three problems. First,
  they involve solving non-convex optimization problems where achieving the global
  optimal is NP-hard. Second, it lacks a theoretical understanding why OPR can lead
  to balancedness. Third, the current generalization error analysis of OPR is not
  directly on the regularizer. In this paper, we address these three issues by (1)
  seeking convex relaxations of the original nonconvex problems so that the global
  optimal is guaranteed to be achievable; (2) providing a formal analysis on OPR’s
  capability of promoting balancedness; (3) providing a theoretical analysis that
  directly reveals the relationship between OPR and generalization performance. Experiments
  on various datasets demonstrate that our convex methods are more effective in promoting
  balancedness, compactness, and generalization, and are computationally more efficient,
  compared with the nonconvex methods.'
