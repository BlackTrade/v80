abstract: We revisit the problem of solving two-player zero-sum games in the decentralized
  setting. We propose a simple algorithmic framework that simultaneously achieves
  the best rates for honest regret as well as adversarial regret, and in addition
  resolves the open problem of removing the logarithmic terms in convergence to the
  value of the game. We achieve this goal in three steps. First, we provide a novel
  analysis of the optimistic mirror descent (OMD), showing that it can be modified
  to guarantee fast convergence for both honest regret and value of the game, when
  the players are playing collaboratively. Second, we propose a new algorithm, dubbed
  as robust optimistic mirror descent (ROMD), which attains optimal adversarial regret
  without knowing the time horizon beforehand. Finally, we propose a simple signaling
  scheme, which enables us to bridge OMD and ROMD to achieve the best of both worlds.
  Numerical examples are presented to support our theoretical claims and show that
  our non-adaptive ROMD algorithm can be competitive to OMD with adaptive step-size
  selection.
