abstract: We study the problem of controlling linear time-invariant systems with known
  noisy dynamics and adversarially chosen quadratic losses. We present the first efficient
  online learning algorithms in this setting that guarantee $O(\sqrtT)$ regret under
  mild assumptions, where $T$ is the time horizon. Our algorithms rely on a novel
  SDP relaxation for the steady-state distribution of the system. Crucially, and in
  contrast to previously proposed relaxations, the feasible solutions of our SDP all
  correspond to “strongly stable” policies that mix exponentially fast to a steady
  state.
