abstract: We study the loss surface of neural networks equipped with a hinge loss
  criterion and ReLU or leaky ReLU nonlinearities. Any such network defines a piecewise
  multilinear form in parameter space. By appealing to harmonic analysis we show that
  all local minima of such network are non-differentiable, except for those minima
  that occur in a region of parameter space where the loss surface is perfectly flat.
  Non-differentiable minima are therefore not technicalities or pathologies; they
  are heart of the problem when investigating the loss of ReLU networks. As a consequence,
  we must employ techniques from nonsmooth analysis to study these loss surfaces.
  We show how to apply these techniques in some illustrative cases.
