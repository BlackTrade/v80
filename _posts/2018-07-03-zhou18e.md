abstract: Thompson sampling has impressive empirical performance for many multi-armed
  bandit problems. But current algorithms for Thompson sampling only work for the
  case of conjugate priors since they require to perform online Bayesian posterior
  inference, which is a difficult task when the prior is not conjugate. In this paper,
  we propose a novel algorithm for Thompson sampling which only requires to draw samples
  from a tractable proposal distribution. So our algorithm is efficient even when
  the prior is non-conjugate. To do this, we reformulate Thompson sampling as an optimization
  proplem via the Gumbel-Max trick. After that we construct a set of random variables
  and our goal is to identify the one with highest mean which is an instance of best
  arm identification problems. Finally, we solve it with techniques in best arm identification.
  Experiments show that our algorithm works well in practice.
