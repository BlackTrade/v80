abstract: Given the importance of clustering in the analysisof large scale data, distributed
  algorithms for formulations such as k-means, k-median, etc. have been extensively
  studied. A successful approach here has been the “reduce and merge” paradigm, in
  which each machine reduces its input size to {Õ}(k), and this data reduction continues
  (possibly iteratively) until all the data fits on one machine, at which point the
  problem is solved locally. This approach has the intrinsic bottleneck that each
  machine must solve a problem of size $≥$ k, and needs to communicate at least $Ω$(k)
  points to the other machines. We propose a novel data partitioning idea to overcome
  this bottleneck, and in effect, have different machines focus on “findingdifferent
  clusters”. Under the assumption that we know the optimum value of the objective
  up to a poly(n) factor (arbitrary polynomial), we establish worst-case approximation
  guarantees for our method. We see that our algorithm results inlower communication
  as well as a near-optimal number of ‘rounds’ of computation (in the popular MapReduce
  framework).
