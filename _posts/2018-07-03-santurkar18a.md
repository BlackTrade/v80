abstract: 'A basic, and still largely unanswered, question in the context of Generative
  Adversarial Networks (GANs) is whether they are truly able to capture all the fundamental
  characteristics of the distributions they are trained on. In particular, evaluating
  the diversity of GAN distributions is challenging and existing methods provide only
  a partial understanding of this issue. In this paper, we develop quantitative and
  scalable tools for assessing the diversity of GAN distributions. Specifically, we
  take a classification-based perspective and view loss of diversity as a form of
  covariate shift introduced by GANs. We examine two specific forms of such shift:
  mode collapse and boundary distortion. In contrast to prior work, our methods need
  only minimal human supervision and can be readily applied to state-of-the-art GANs
  on large, canonical datasets. Examining popular GANs using our tools indicates that
  these GANs have significant problems in reproducing the more distributional properties
  of their training dataset.'
