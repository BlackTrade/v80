abstract: In this paper, we propose and study opportunistic bandits - a new variant
  of bandits where the regret of pulling a suboptimal arm varies under different environmental
  conditions, such as network load or produce price. When the load/price is low, so
  is the cost/regret of pulling a suboptimal arm (e.g., trying a suboptimal network
  configuration). Therefore, intuitively, we could explore more when the load/price
  is low and exploit more when the load/price is high. Inspired by this intuition,
  we propose an Adaptive Upper-Confidence-Bound (AdaUCB) algorithm to adaptively balance
  the exploration-exploitation tradeoff for opportunistic bandits. We prove that AdaUCB
  achieves O(log T) regret with a smaller coefficient than the traditional UCB algorithm.
  Furthermore, AdaUCB achieves O(1) regret with respect to T if the exploration cost
  is zero when the load level is below a certain threshold. Last, based on both synthetic
  data and real-world traces, experimental results show that AdaUCB significantly
  outperforms other bandit algorithms, such as UCB and TS (Thompson Sampling), under
  large load/price fluctuations.
