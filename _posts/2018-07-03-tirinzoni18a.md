abstract: We consider the transfer of experience samples (i.e., tuples < s, a, sâ€™,
  r >) in reinforcement learning (RL), collected from a set of source tasks to improve
  the learning process in a given target task. Most of the related approaches focus
  on selecting the most relevant source samples for solving the target task, but then
  all the transferred samples are used without considering anymore the discrepancies
  between the task models. In this paper, we propose a model-based technique that
  automatically estimates the relevance (importance weight) of each source sample
  for solving the target task. In the proposed approach, all the samples are transferred
  and used by a batch RL algorithm to solve the target task, but their contribution
  to the learning process is proportional to their importance weight. By extending
  the results for importance weighting provided in supervised learning literature,
  we develop a finite-sample analysis of the proposed batch RL algorithm. Furthermore,
  we empirically compare the proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art approaches, showing
  that it achieves better learning performance and is very robust to negative transfer,
  even when some source tasks are significantly different from the target task.
