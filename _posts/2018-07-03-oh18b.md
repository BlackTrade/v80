abstract: This paper proposes Self-Imitation Learning (SIL), a simple off-policy actor-critic
  algorithm that learns to reproduce the agentâ€™s past good decisions. This algorithm
  is designed to verify our hypothesis that exploiting past good experiences can indirectly
  drive deep exploration. Our empirical results show that SIL significantly improves
  advantage actor-critic (A2C) on several hard exploration Atari games and is competitive
  to the state-of-the-art count-based exploration methods. We also show that SIL improves
  proximal policy optimization (PPO) on MuJoCo tasks.
