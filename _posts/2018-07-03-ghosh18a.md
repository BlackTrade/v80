abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently received increasing attention
  for their ability to provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainties. However, model
  selection—even choosing the number of nodes—remains an open question. Recent work
  has proposed the use of a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a Bayesian
  neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help explain the data.
  In this work, we propose several modeling and inference advances that consistently
  improve the compactness of the model learned while maintaining predictive performance,
  especially in smaller-sample settings including reinforcement learning.
