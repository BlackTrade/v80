abstract: The large memory requirements of deep neural networks limit their deployment
  and adoption on many devices. Model compression methods effectively reduce the memory
  requirements of these models, usually through applying transformations such as weight
  pruning or quantization. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for lossy weight
  encoding co-designed with weight simplification techniques. The encoding is based
  on the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure that can save space at the
  cost of introducing random errors. Leveraging the ability of neural networks to
  tolerate these imperfections and by re-training around the errors, the proposed
  technique, named Weightless, can compress weights by up to 496x without loss of
  model accuracy. This results in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art.
