abstract: This paper investigates recently proposed approaches for defending against
  adversarial examples and evaluating adversarial robustness. We motivate <em>adversarial
  risk</em> as an objective for achieving models robust to worst-case inputs. We then
  frame commonly used attacks and evaluation metrics as defining a tractable surrogate
  objective to the true adversarial risk. This suggests that models may optimize this
  surrogate rather than the true adversarial risk. We formalize this notion as <em>obscurity
  to an adversary</em>, and develop tools and heuristics for identifying obscured
  models and designing transparent models. We demonstrate that this is a significant
  problem in practice by repurposing gradient-free optimization techniques into adversarial
  attacks, which we use to decrease the accuracy of several recently proposed defenses
  to near zero. Our hope is that our formulations and results will help researchers
  to develop more powerful defenses.
