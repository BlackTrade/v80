abstract: We consider the problem of learning causal DAGs in the setting where both
  observational and interventional data is available. This setting is common in biology,
  where gene regulatory networks can be intervened on using chemical reagents or gene
  deletions. Hauser & Buhlmann (2012) previously characterized the identifiability
  of causal DAGs under perfect interventions, which eliminate dependencies between
  targeted variables and their direct causes. In this paper, we extend these identifiability
  results to general interventions, which may modify the dependencies between targeted
  variables and their causes without eliminating them. We define and characterize
  the interventional Markov equivalence class that can be identified from general
  (not necessarily perfect) intervention experiments. We also propose the first provably
  consistent algorithm for learning DAGs in this setting and evaluate our algorithm
  on simulated and biological datasets.
