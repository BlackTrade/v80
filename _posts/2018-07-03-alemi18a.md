abstract: Recent work in unsupervised representation learning has focused on learning
  deep directed latentvariable models. Fitting these models by maximizing the marginal
  likelihood or evidence is typically intractable, thus a common approximation is
  to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) instead. However, maximum likelihood
  training (whether exact or approximate) does not necessarily result in a good latent
  representation, as we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically. In particular,
  we derive variational lower and upper bounds on the mutual information between the
  input and the latent variable, and use these bounds to derive a rate-distortion
  curve that characterizes the tradeoff between compression and reconstruction accuracy.
  Using this framework, we demonstrate that there is a family of models with identical
  ELBO, but different quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Our framework
  also suggests a simple new method to ensure that latent variable models with powerful
  stochastic decoders do not ignore their latent code.
