abstract: We study active object tracking, where a tracker takes as input the visual
  observation (i.e. frame sequence) and produces the camera control signal (e.g.,
  move forward, turn left, etc). Conventional methods tackle the tracking and the
  camera control separately, which is challenging to tune jointly. It also incurs
  many human efforts for labeling and many expensive trial-and-errors in real-world.
  To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an end-to-end solution via deep
  reinforcement learning, where a ConvNet-LSTM function approximator is adopted for
  the direct frame-to-action prediction. We further propose an environment augmentation
  technique and a customized reward function, which are crucial for a successful training.
  The tracker trained in simulators (ViZDoom, Unreal Engine) shows good generalization
  in the case of unseen object moving path, unseen object appearance, unseen background,
  and distracting object. It can restore tracking when occasionally losing the target.
  With the experiments over the VOT dataset, we also find that the tracking ability,
  obtained solely from simulators, can potentially transfer to real-world scenarios.
