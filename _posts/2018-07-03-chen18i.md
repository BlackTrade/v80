abstract: Recurrent neural networks have gained widespread use in modeling sequence
  data across various domains. While many successful recurrent architectures employ
  a notion of gating, the exact mechanism that enables such remarkable performance
  is not well understood. We develop a theory for signal propagation in recurrent
  networks after random initialization using a combination of mean field theory and
  random matrix theory. To simplify our discussion, we introduce a new RNN cell with
  a simple gating mechanism that we call the minimalRNN and compare it with vanilla
  RNNs. Our theory allows us to define a maximum timescale over which RNNs can remember
  an input. We show that this theory predicts trainability for both recurrent architectures.
  We show that gated recurrent networks feature a much broader, more robust, trainable
  region than vanilla RNNs, which corroborates recent experimental findings. Finally,
  we develop a closed-form critical initialization scheme that achieves dynamical
  isometry in both vanilla RNNs and minimalRNNs. We show that this results in significantly
  improved training dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the minimalRNN achieves
  comparable performance to its more complex counterparts, such as LSTMs or GRUs,
  on a language modeling task.
