abstract: We introduce a principled approach for <em>simultaneous mapping and clustering</em>
  (SMAC) for establishing consistent maps across heterogeneous object collections
  (e.g., 2D images or 3D shapes). Our approach takes as input a heterogeneous object
  collection and a set of maps computed between some pairs of objects, and outputs
  a homogeneous object clustering together with a new set of maps possessing optimal
  intra- and inter-cluster consistency. Our approach is based on the spectral decomposition
  of a data matrix storing all pairwise maps in its blocks. We additionally provide
  tight theoretical guarantees on the exactness of SMAC under established noise models.
  We also demonstrate the usefulness of the approach on synthetic and real datasets.
