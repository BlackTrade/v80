abstract: Filters in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) contain model parameters
  learned from enormous amounts of data. In this paper, we suggest to decompose convolutional
  filters in CNN as a truncated expansion with pre-fixed bases, namely the Decomposed
  Convolutional Filters network (DCFNet), where the expansion coefficients remain
  learned from data. Such a structure not only reduces the number of trainable parameters
  and computation, but also imposes filter regularity by bases truncation. Through
  extensive experiments, we consistently observe that DCFNet maintains accuracy for
  image classification tasks with a significant reduction of model parameters, particularly
  with Fourier-Bessel (FB) bases, and even with random bases. Theoretically, we analyze
  the representation stability of DCFNet with respect to input variations, and prove
  representation stability under generic assumptions on the expansion coefficients.
  The analysis is consistent with the empirical observations.
