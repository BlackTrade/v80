abstract: We examine the impact of learning Lipschitz continuous models in the context
  of model-based reinforcement learning. We provide a novel bound on multi-step prediction
  error of Lipschitz models where we quantify the error using the Wasserstein metric.
  We go on to prove an error bound for the value-function estimate arising from Lipschitz
  models and show that the estimated value function is itself Lipschitz. We conclude
  with empirical results that show the benefits of controlling the Lipschitz constant
  of neural-network models.
