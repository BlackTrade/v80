abstract: Neural networks trained with backpropagation often struggle to identify
  classes that have been observed a small number of times. In applications where most
  class labels are rare, such as language modelling, this can become a performance
  bottleneck. One potential remedy is to augment the network with a fast-learning
  non-parametric model which stores recent activations and class labels into an external
  memory. We explore a simplified architecture where we treat a subset of the model
  parameters as fast memory stores. This can help retain information over longer time
  intervals than a traditional memory, and does not require additional space or compute.
  In the case of image classification, we display faster binding of novel classes
  on an Omniglot image curriculum task. We also show improved performance for word-based
  language models on news reports (GigaWord), books (Project Gutenberg) and Wikipedia
  articles (WikiText-103) - the latter achieving a state-of-the-art perplexity of
  29.2.
