abstract: We show that Entropy-SGD (Chaudhari et al., 2017), when viewed as a learning
  algorithm, optimizes a PAC-Bayes bound on the risk of a Gibbs (posterior) classifier,
  i.e., a randomized classifier obtained by a risk-sensitive perturbation of the weights
  of a learned classifier. Entropy-SGD works by optimizing the boundâ€™s prior, violating
  the hypothesis of the PAC-Bayes theorem that the prior is chosen independently of
  the data. Indeed, available implementations of Entropy-SGD rapidly obtain zero training
  error on random labels and the same holds of the Gibbs posterior. In order to obtain
  a valid generalization bound, we rely on a result showing that data-dependent priors
  obtained by stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) yield valid PAC-Bayes bounds
  provided the target distribution of SGLD is eps-differentially private. We observe
  that test error on MNIST and CIFAR10 falls within the (empirically nonvacuous) risk
  bounds computed under the assumption that SGLD reaches stationarity. In particular,
  Entropy-SGLD can be configured to yield relatively tight generalization bounds and
  still fit real labels, although these same settings do not obtain state-of-the-art
  performance.
