abstract: Policy optimization is a core component of reinforcement learning (RL),
  and most existing RL methods directly optimize parameters of a policy based on maximizing
  the expected total reward, or its surrogate. Though often achieving encouraging
  empirical success, its correspondence to policy-distribution optimization has been
  unclear mathematically. We place policy optimization into the space of probability
  measures, and interpret it as Wasserstein gradient flows. On the probability-measure
  space, under specified circumstances, policy optimization becomes convex in terms
  of distribution optimization. To make optimization feasible, we develop efficient
  algorithms by numerically solving the corresponding discrete gradient flows. Our
  technique is applicable to several RL settings, and is related to many state-of-the-art
  policy-optimization algorithms. Specifically, we define gradient flows on both the
  parameter-distribution space and policy-distribution space, leading to what we term
  indirect-policy and direct-policy learning frameworks, respectively. Extensive experiments
  verify the effectiveness of our framework, often obtaining better performance compared
  to related algorithms.
