abstract: In large-scale machine learning applications and high-dimensional statistics,
  it is ubiquitous to address a considerable number of features among which many are
  redundant. As a remedy, online feature selection has attracted increasing attention
  in recent years. It sequentially reveals features and evaluates the importance of
  them. Though online feature selection has proven an elegant methodology, it is usually
  challenging to carry out a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work,
  we propose a provable online feature selection algorithm that utilizes the online
  leverage score. The selected features are then fed to $k$-means clustering, making
  the clustering step memory and computationally efficient. We prove that with high
  probability, performing $k$-means clustering based on the selected feature space
  does not deviate far from the optimal clustering using the original data. The empirical
  results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
