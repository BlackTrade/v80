abstract: 'Gibbs sampling is the de facto Markov chain Monte Carlo method used for
  inference and learning on large scale graphical models. For complicated factor graphs
  with lots of factors, the performance of Gibbs sampling can be limited by the computational
  cost of executing a single update step of the Markov chain. This cost is proportional
  to the degree of the graph, the number of factors adjacent to each variable. In
  this paper, we show how this cost can be reduced by using minibatching: subsampling
  the factors to form an estimate of their sum. We introduce several minibatched variants
  of Gibbs, show that they can be made unbiased, prove bounds on their convergence
  rates, and show that under some conditions they can result in asymptotic single-update-run-time
  speedups over plain Gibbs sampling.'
