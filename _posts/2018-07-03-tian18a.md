abstract: Word embedding is a useful approach to capture co-occurrence structures
  in large text corpora. However, in addition to the text data itself, we often have
  additional covariates associated with individual corpus documents—e.g. the demographic
  of the author, time and venue of publication—and we would like the embedding to
  naturally capture this information. We propose CoVeR, a new tensor decomposition
  model for vector embeddings with covariates. CoVeR jointly learns a <em>base</em>
  embedding for all the words as well as a weighted diagonal matrix to model how each
  covariate affects the base embedding. To obtain author or venue-specific embedding,
  for example, we can then simply multiply the base embedding by the associated transformation
  matrix. The main advantages of our approach are data efficiency and interpretability
  of the covariate transformation. Our experiments demonstrate that our joint model
  learns substantially better covariate-specific embeddings compared to the standard
  approach of learning a separate embedding for each covariate using only the relevant
  subset of data, as well as other related methods. Furthermore, CoVeR encourages
  the embeddings to be “topic-aligned” in that the dimensions have specific independent
  meanings. This allows our covariate-specific embeddings to be compared by topic,
  enabling downstream differential analysis. We empirically evaluate the benefits
  of our algorithm on datasets, and demonstrate how it can be used to address many
  natural questions about covariate effects.
