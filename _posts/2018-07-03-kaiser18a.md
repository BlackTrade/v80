abstract: Autoregressive sequence models based on deep neural networks, such as RNNs,
  Wavenet and Transformer are the state-of-the-art on many tasks. However, they lack
  parallelism and are thus slow for long sequences. RNNs lack parallelism both during
  training and decoding, while architectures like WaveNet and Transformer are much
  more parallel during training, but still lack parallelism during decoding. We present
  a method to extend sequence models using discrete latent variables that makes decoding
  much more parallel. The main idea behind this approach is to first autoencode the
  target sequence into a shorter discrete latent sequence, which is generated autoregressively,
  and finally decode the full sequence from this shorter latent sequence in a parallel
  manner. To this end, we introduce a new method for constructing discrete latent
  variables and compare it with previously introduced methods. Finally, we verify
  that our model works on the task of neural machine translation, where our models
  are an order of magnitude faster than comparable autoregressive models and, while
  lower in BLEU than purely autoregressive models, better than previously proposed
  non-autogregressive translation.
