abstract: The approximation power of general feedforward neural networks with piecewise
  linear activation functions is investigated. First, lower bounds on the size of
  a network are established in terms of the approximation error and network depth
  and width. These bounds improve upon state-of-the-art bounds for certain classes
  of functions, such as strongly convex functions. Second, an upper bound is established
  on the difference of two neural networks with identical weights but different activation
  functions.
