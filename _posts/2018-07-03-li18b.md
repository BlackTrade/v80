abstract: Deep learning is formulated as a discrete-time optimal control problem.
  This allows one to characterize necessary conditions for optimality and developtraining
  algorithms that do not rely on gradients with respect to the trainable parameters.
  In particular, we introduce the discrete-time method of successive approximations
  (MSA), which is based on the Pontryaginâ€™s maximum principle, for training neural
  networks. A rigorous error estimate for the discrete MSA is obtained, which sheds
  light on its dynamics and the means to stabilize the algorithm. The developed methods
  are applied to train, in a rather principled way, neural networks with weights that
  are constrained to take values in a discrete set.We obtain competitive performance
  and interestingly, very sparse weights in the case of ternary networks, which may
  be useful in model deployment in low-memory devices.
