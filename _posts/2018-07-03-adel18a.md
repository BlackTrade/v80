abstract: Interpretability of representations in both deep generative and discriminative
  models is highly desirable. Current methods jointly optimize an objective combining
  accuracy and interpretability. However, this may reduce accuracy, and is not applicable
  to already trained models. We propose two interpretability frameworks. First, we
  provide an interpretable lens for an existing model. We use a generative model which
  takes as input the representation in an existing (generative or discriminative)
  model, weakly supervised by limited side information. Applying a flexible and invertible
  transformation to the input leads to an interpretable representation with no loss
  in accuracy. We extend the approach using an active learning strategy to choose
  the most useful side information to obtain, allowing a human to guide what "interpretable"
  means. Our second framework relies on joint optimization for a representation which
  is both maximally informative about the side information and maximally compressive
  about the non-interpretable data factors. This leads to a novel perspective on the
  relationship between compression and regularization. We also propose a new interpretability
  evaluation metric based on our framework. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art
  results on three datasets using the two proposed algorithms.
