abstract: We establish a data-dependent notion of algorithmic stability for Stochastic
  Gradient Descent (SGD), and employ it to develop novel generalization bounds. This
  is in contrast to previous distribution-free algorithmic stability results for SGD
  which depend on the worst-case constants. By virtue of the data-dependent argument,
  our bounds provide new insights into learning with SGD on convex and non-convex
  problems. In the convex case, we show that the bound on the generalization error
  depends on the risk at the initialization point. In the non-convex case, we prove
  that the expected curvature of the objective function around the initialization
  point has crucial influence on the generalization error. In both cases, our results
  suggest a simple data-driven strategy to stabilize SGD by pre-screening its initialization.
  As a corollary, our results allow us to show optimistic generalization bounds that
  exhibit fast convergence rates for SGD subject to a vanishing empirical risk and
  low noise of stochastic gradient.
