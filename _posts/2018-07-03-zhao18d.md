abstract: We propose a novel and flexible rank-breaking-then-composite-marginal-likelihood
  (RBCML) framework for learning random utility models (RUMs), which include the Plackett-Luce
  model. We characterize conditions for the objective function of RBCML to be strictly
  log-concave by proving that strict log-concavity is preserved under convolution
  and marginalization. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for RBCML
  to satisfy consistency and asymptotic normality. Experiments on synthetic data show
  that RBCML for Gaussian RUMs achieves better statistical efficiency and computation
  efficiency than the state-of-the-art algorithm and our RBCML for the Plackett-Luce
  model provides flexible tradeoffs between running time and statistical efficiency.
