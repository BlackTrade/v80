abstract: An appealing property of the natural gradient is that it is invariant to
  arbitrary differentiable reparameterizations of the model. However, this invariance
  property requires infinitesimal steps and is lost in practical implementations with
  small but finite step sizes. In this paper, we study invariance properties from
  a combined perspective of Riemannian geometry and numerical differential equation
  solving. We define the order of invariance of a numerical method to be its convergence
  order to an invariant solution. We propose to use higher-order integrators and geodesic
  corrections to obtain more invariant optimization trajectories. We prove the numerical
  convergence properties of geodesic corrected updates and show that they can be as
  computational efficient as plain natural gradient. Experimentally, we demonstrate
  that invariance leads to faster optimization and our techniques improve on traditional
  natural gradient in deep neural network training and natural policy gradient for
  reinforcement learning.
