abstract: In this paper, we model the problem of optimizing crowdfunding platforms,
  such as the non-profit Kiva or for-profit KickStarter, as a variant of the multi-armed
  bandit problem. In our setting, Bernoulli arms emit no rewards until their cumulative
  number of successes over any number of trials exceeds a fixed threshold and then
  provides no additional reward for any additional trials - a process reminiscent
  to that of a neuron firing once it reaches the action potential and then saturates.
  In the spirit of an infinite armed bandit problem, the player can add new arms whose
  expected probability of success is drawn iid from an unknown distribution â€“ this
  endless supply of projects models the harsh reality that the number of projects
  seeking funding greatly exceeds the total capital available by lenders. Crowdfunding
  platforms naturally fall under this setting where the arms are potential projects,
  and their probability of success is the probability that a potential funder decides
  to fund it after reviewing it. The goal is to play arms (prioritize the display
  of projects on a webpage) to maximize the number of arms that reach the firing threshold
  (meet their goal amount) using as few total trials (number of impressions) as possible
  over all the played arms. We provide an algorithm for this setting and prove sublinear
  regret bounds.
