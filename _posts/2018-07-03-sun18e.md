abstract: The generalization properties of Gaussian processes depend heavily on the
  choice of kernel, and this choice remains a dark art. We present the Neural Kernel
  Network (NKN), a flexible family of kernels represented by a neural network. The
  NKN’s architecture is based on the composition rules for kernels, so that each unit
  of the network corresponds to a valid kernel. It can compactly approximate compositional
  kernel structures such as those used by the Automatic Statistician (Lloyd et al.,
  2014), but because the architecture is differentiable, it is end-to-end trainable
  with gradient- based optimization. We show that the NKN is universal for the class
  of stationary kernels. Empirically we demonstrate NKN’s pattern discovery and extrapolation
  abilities on several tasks that depend crucially on identifying the underlying structure,
  including time series and texture extrapolation, as well as Bayesian optimization.
