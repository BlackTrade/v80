abstract: We present an approximation algorithm that takes a pool of pre-trained models
  as input and produces from it a cascaded model with similar accuracy but lower average-case
  cost. Applied to state-of-the-art ImageNet classification models, this yields up
  to a 2x reduction in floating point multiplications, and up to a 6x reduction in
  average-case memory I/O. The auto-generated cascades exhibit intuitive properties,
  such as using lower-resolution input for easier images and requiring higher prediction
  confidence when using a computationally cheaper model.
