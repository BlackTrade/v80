abstract: Learning to coordinate between multiple agents is an important problem in
  many reinforcement learning problems. Key to learning to coordinate is exploiting
  loose couplings, i.e., conditional independences between agents. In this paper we
  study learning in repeated fully cooperative games, multi-agent multi-armed bandits
  (MAMABs), in which the expected rewards can be expressed as a coordination graph.
  We propose multi-agent upper confidence exploration (MAUCE), a new algorithm for
  MAMABs that exploits loose couplings, which enables us to prove a regret bound that
  is logarithmic in the number of arm pulls and only linear in the number of agents.
  We empirically compare MAUCE to sparse cooperative Q-learning, and a state-of-the-art
  combinatorial bandit approach, and show that it performs much better on a variety
  of settings, including learning control policies for wind farms.
