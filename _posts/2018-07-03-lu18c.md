abstract: We tackle the problem of optimizing a black-box objective function defined
  over a highly-structured input space. This problem is ubiquitous in science and
  engineering. In machine learning, inferring the structure of a neural network or
  the Automatic Statistician (AS), where the optimal kernel combination for a Gaussian
  process is selected, are two important examples. We use the \as as a case study
  to describe our approach, that can be easily generalized to other domains. We propose
  an Structure Generating Variational Auto-encoder (SG-VAE) to embed the original
  space of kernel combinations into some low-dimensional continuous manifold where
  Bayesian optimization (BO) ideas are used. This is possible when structural knowledge
  of the problem is available, which can be given via a simulator or any other form
  of generating potentially good solutions. The right exploration-exploitation balance
  is imposed by propagating into the search the uncertainty of the latent space of
  the SG-VAE, that is computed using variational inference. The key aspect of our
  approach is that the SG-VAE can be used to bias the search towards relevant regions,
  making it suitable for transfer learning tasks. Several experiments in various application
  domains are used to illustrate the utility and generality of the approach described
  in this work.
