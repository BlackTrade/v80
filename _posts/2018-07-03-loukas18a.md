abstract: How does coarsening affect the spectrum of a general graph? We provide conditions
  such that the principal eigenvalues and eigenspaces of a coarsened and original
  graph Laplacian matrices are close. The achieved approximation is shown to depend
  on standard graph-theoretic properties, such as the degree and eigenvalue distributions,
  as well as on the ratio between the coarsened and actual graph sizes. Our results
  carry implications for learning methods that utilize coarsening. For the particular
  case of spectral clustering, they imply that coarse eigenvectors can be used to
  derive good quality assignments even without refinement{â€”}this phenomenon was previously
  observed, but lacked formal justification.
