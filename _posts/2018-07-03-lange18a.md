abstract: 'Weighted correlation clustering is hard to solve and hard to approximate
  for general graphs. Its applications in network analysis and computer vision call
  for efficient algorithms. To this end, we make three contributions: We establish
  partial optimality conditions that can be checked efficiently, and doing so recursively
  solves the problem for series-parallel graphs to optimality, in linear time. We
  exploit the packing dual of the problem to compute a heuristic, but non-trivial
  lower bound faster than that of a canonical linear program relaxation. We introduce
  a re-weighting with the dual solution by which efficient local search algorithms
  converge to better feasible solutions. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated
  empirically on a number of benchmark instances.'
