abstract: In this paper, we propose a Minimax Concave Penalized Multi-Armed Bandit
  (MCP-Bandit) algorithm for a decision-maker facing high-dimensional data with latent
  sparse structure in an online learning and decision-making process. We demonstrate
  that the MCP-Bandit algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal cumulative regret
  in sample size T, O(log T), and further attains a tighter bound in both covariates
  dimension d and the number of significant covariates s, O(s^2 (s + log d). In addition,
  we develop a linear approximation method, the 2-step Weighted Lasso procedure, to
  identify the MCP estimator for the MCP-Bandit algorithm under non-i.i.d. samples.
  Using this procedure, the MCP estimator matches the oracle estimator with high probability.
  Finally, we present two experiments to benchmark our proposed the MCP-Bandit algorithm
  to other bandit algorithms. Both experiments demonstrate that the MCP-Bandit algorithm
  performs favorably over other benchmark algorithms, especially when there is a high
  level of data sparsity or when the sample size is not too small.
