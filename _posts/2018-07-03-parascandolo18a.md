abstract: Statistical learning relies upon data sampled from a distribution, and we
  usually do not care what actually generated it in the first place. From the point
  of view of causal modeling, the structure of each distribution is induced by physical
  mechanisms that give rise to dependences between observables. Mechanisms, however,
  can be meaningful autonomous modules of generative models that make sense beyond
  a particular entailed data distribution, lending themselves to transfer between
  problems.We develop an algorithm to recover a set of independent (inverse) mechanisms
  from a set of transformed data points. The approach is unsupervised and based on
  a set of experts that compete for data generated by the mechanisms, driving specialization.
  We analyze the proposed method in a series of experiments on image data. Each expert
  learns to map a subset of the transformed data back to a reference distribution.
  The learned mechanisms generalize to novel domains. We discuss implications for
  transfer learning and links to recent trends in generative modeling.
