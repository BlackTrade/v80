abstract: Due to the rapid growth of data and computational resources, distributed
  optimization has become an active research area in recent years. While first-order
  methods seem to dominate the field, second-order methods are nevertheless attractive
  as they potentially require fewer communication rounds to converge. However, there
  are significant drawbacks that impede their wide adoption, such as the computation
  and the communication of a large Hessian matrix. In this paper we present a new
  algorithm for distributed training of generalized linear models that only requires
  the computation of diagonal blocks of the Hessian matrix on the individual workers.
  To deal with this approximate information we propose an adaptive approach that -
  akin to trust-region methods - dynamically adapts the auxiliary model to compensate
  for modeling errors. We provide theoretical rates of convergence for a wide class
  of problems including $L_1$-regularized objectives. We also demonstrate that our
  approach achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple large benchmark datasets.
