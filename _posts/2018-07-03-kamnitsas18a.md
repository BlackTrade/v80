abstract: We present a novel cost function for semi-supervised learning of neural
  networks that encourages compact clustering of the latent space to facilitate separation.
  The key idea is to dynamically create a graph over embeddings of labeled and unlabeled
  samples of a training batch to capture underlying structure in feature space, and
  use label propagation to estimate its high and low density regions. We then devise
  a cost function based on Markov chains on the graph that regularizes the latent
  space to form a single compact cluster per class, while avoiding to disturb existing
  clusters during optimization. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks and compare
  to state-of-the art with promising results. Our approach combines the benefits of
  graph-based regularization with efficient, inductive inference, does not require
  modifications to a network architecture, and can thus be easily applied to existing
  networks to enable an effective use of unlabeled data.
