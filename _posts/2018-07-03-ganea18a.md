abstract: Learning graph representations via low-dimensional embeddings that preserve
  relevant network properties is an important class of problems in machine learning.
  We here present a novel method to embed directed acyclic graphs. Following prior
  work, we first advocate for using hyperbolic spaces which provably model tree-like
  structures better than Euclidean geometry. Second, we view hierarchical relations
  as partial orders defined using a family of nested geodesically convex cones. We
  prove that these entailment cones admit an optimal shape with a closed form expression
  both in the Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, and they canonically define the embedding
  learning process. Experiments show significant improvements of our method over strong
  recent baselines both in terms of representational capacity and generalization.
