abstract: We present a stochastic algorithm to compute the barycenter of a set of
  probability distributions under the Wasserstein metric from optimal transport. Unlike
  previous approaches, our method extends to continuous input distributions and allows
  the support of the barycenter to be adjusted in each iteration. We tackle the problem
  without regularization, allowing us to recover a sharp output whose support is contained
  within the support of the true barycenter. We give examples where our algorithm
  recovers a more meaningful barycenter than previous work. Our method is versatile
  and can be extended to applications such as generating super samples from a given
  distribution and recovering blue noise approximations.
