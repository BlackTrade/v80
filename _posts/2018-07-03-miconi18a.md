abstract: 'How can we build agents that keep learning from experience, quickly and
  efficiently, after their initial training? Here we take inspiration from the main
  mechanism of learning in biological brains: synaptic plasticity, carefully tuned
  by evolution to produce efficient lifelong learning. We show that plasticity, just
  like connection weights, can be optimized by gradient descent in large (millions
  of parameters) recurrent networks with Hebbian plastic connections. First, recurrent
  plastic networks with more than two million parameters can be trained to memorize
  and reconstruct sets of novel, high-dimensional (1000+ pixels) natural images not
  seen during training. Crucially, traditional non-plastic recurrent networks fail
  to solve this task. Furthermore, trained plastic networks can also solve generic
  meta-learning tasks such as the Omniglot task, with competitive results and little
  parameter overhead. Finally, in reinforcement learning settings, plastic networks
  outperform non-plastic equivalent in a maze exploration task. We conclude that differentiable
  plasticity may provide a powerful novel approach to the learning-to-learn problem.'
