abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning algorithm consisting
  in a stochastic variance-reduced version of policy gradient for solving Markov Decision
  Processes (MDPs). Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) methods have proven
  to be very successful in supervised learning. However, their adaptation to policy
  gradient is not straightforward and needs to account for I) a non-concave objective
  function; II) approximations in the full gradient computation; and III) a non-stationary
  sampling process. The result is SVRPG, a stochastic variance-reduced policy gradient
  algorithm that leverages on importance weights to preserve the unbiasedness of the
  gradient estimate. Under standard assumptions on the MDP, we provide convergence
  guarantees for SVRPG with a convergence rate that is linear under increasing batch
  sizes. Finally, we suggest practical variants of SVRPG, and we empirically evaluate
  them on continuous MDPs.
