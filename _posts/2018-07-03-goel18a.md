abstract: 'We give the first provably efficient algorithm for learning a one hidden
  layer convolutional network with respect to a general class of (potentially overlapping)
  patches under mild conditions on the underlying distribution. We prove that our
  framework captures commonly used schemes from computer vision, including one-dimensional
  and two-dimensional “patch and stride” convolutions. Our algorithm– <em>Convotron</em>–
  is inspired by recent work applying isotonic regression to learning neural networks.
  Convotron uses a simple, iterative update rule that is stochastic in nature and
  tolerant to noise (requires only that the conditional mean function is a one layer
  convolutional network, as opposed to the realizable setting). In contrast to gradient
  descent, Convotron requires no special initialization or learning-rate tuning to
  converge to the global optimum. We also point out that learning one hidden convolutional
  layer with respect to a Gaussian distribution and just <em>one</em> disjoint patch
  $P$ (the other patches may be arbitrary) is <em>easy</em> in the following sense:
  Convotron can efficiently recover the hidden weight vector by updating <em>only</em>
  in the direction of $P$.'
