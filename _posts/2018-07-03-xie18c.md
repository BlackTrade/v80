abstract: It is important to transfer the knowledge from label-rich source domain
  to unlabeled target domain due to the expensive cost of manual labeling efforts.
  Prior domain adaptation methods address this problem through aligning the global
  distribution statistics between source domain and target domain, but a drawback
  of prior methods is that they ignore the semantic information contained in samples,
  e.g., features of backpacks in target domain might be mapped near features of cars
  in source domain. In this paper, we present moving semantic transfer network, which
  learn semantic representations for unlabeled target samples by aligning labeled
  source centroid and pseudo-labeled target centroid. Features in same class but different
  domains are expected to be mapped nearby, resulting in an improved target classification
  accuracy. Moving average centroid alignment is cautiously designed to compensate
  the insufficient categorical information within each mini batch. Experiments testify
  that our model yields state of the art results on standard datasets.
