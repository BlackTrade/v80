abstract: We introduce instancewise feature selection as a methodology for model interpretation.
  Our method is based on learning a function to extract a subset of features that
  are most informative for each given example. This feature selector is trained to
  maximize the mutual information between selected features and the response variable,
  where the conditional distribution of the response variable given the input is the
  model to be explained. We develop an efficient variational approximation to the
  mutual information, and show the effectiveness of our method on a variety of synthetic
  and real data sets using both quantitative metrics and human evaluation.
