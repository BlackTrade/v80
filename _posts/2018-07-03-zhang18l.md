abstract: Variational Bayesian neural nets combine the flexibility of deep learning
  with Bayesian uncertainty estimation. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between
  cheap but simple variational families (e.g. fully factorized) or expensive and complicated
  inference procedures. We show that natural gradient ascent with adaptive weight
  noise implicitly fits a variational posterior to maximize the evidence lower bound
  (ELBO). This insight allows us to train full-covariance, fully factorized, or matrix-variate
  Gaussian variational posteriors using noisy versions of natural gradient, Adam,
  and K-FAC, respectively, making it possible to scale up to modern-size ConvNets.
  On standard regression benchmarks, our noisy K-FAC algorithm makes better predictions
  and matches Hamiltonian Monte Carlo’s predictive variances better than existing
  methods. Its improved uncertainty estimates lead to more efficient exploration in
  active learning, and intrinsic motivation for reinforcement learning.
