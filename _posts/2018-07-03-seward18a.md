abstract: GANs excel at learning high dimensional distributions, but they can update
  generator parameters in directions that do not correspond to the steepest descent
  direction of the objective. Prominent examples of problematic update directions
  include those used in both Goodfellow’s original GAN and the WGAN-GP. To formally
  describe an optimal update direction, we introduce a theoretical framework which
  allows the derivation of requirements on both the divergence and corresponding method
  for determining an update direction, with these requirements guaranteeing unbiased
  mini-batch updates in the direction of steepest descent. We propose a novel divergence
  which approximates the Wasserstein distance while regularizing the critic’s first
  order information. Together with an accompanying update direction, this divergence
  fulfills the requirements for unbiased steepest descent updates. We verify our method,
  the First Order GAN, with image generation on CelebA, LSUN and CIFAR-10 and set
  a new state of the art on the One Billion Word language generation task.
