abstract: Given a large matrix $A\in\real^{n\times d}$, we consider the problem of
  computing a sketch matrix $B\in\real^{\ell\times d}$ which is significantly smaller
  than but still well approximates $A$. We are interested in minimizing the <em>covariance
  error</em> $\norm{A^TA-B^TB}_2.$We consider the problems in the streaming model,
  where the algorithm can only make one pass over the input with limited working space.
  The popular Frequent Directions algorithm of Liberty (2013) and its variants achieve
  optimal space-error tradeoff. However, whether the running time can be improved
  remains an unanswered question.In this paper, we almost settle the time complexity
  of this problem. In particular, we provide new space-optimal algorithms with faster
  running times. Moreover, we also show that the running times of our algorithms are
  near-optimal unless the state-of-the-art running time of matrix multiplication can
  be improved significantly.
