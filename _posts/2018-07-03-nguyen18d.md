abstract: Much recent work on large-scale visual recogni- tion aims to scale up learning
  to massive, noisily- annotated datasets. We address the problem of scaling-up the
  evaluation of such models to large- scale datasets with noisy labels. Current protocols
  for doing so require a human user to either vet (re-annotate) a small fraction of
  the testset and ignore the rest, or else correct errors in annotation as they are
  found through manual inspection of results. In this work, we re-formulate the problem
  as one of active testing, and examine strategies for efficiently querying a user
  so as to obtain an accurate performance estimate with minimal vet- ting. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our proposed active testing framework on estimating two performance
  metrics, Precision@K and mean Average Precisions, for two popular Computer Vi- sion
  tasks, multilabel classification and instance segmentation, respectively. We further
  show that our approach is able to siginificantly save human annotation effort and
  more robust than alterna- tive evaluation protocols.
