abstract: We present a novel way of generating Lyapunov functions for proving linear
  convergence rates of first-order optimization methods. Our approach provably obtains
  the fastest linear convergence rate that can be verified by a quadratic Lyapunov
  function (with given states), and only relies on solving a small-sized semidefinite
  program. Our approach combines the advantages of performance estimation problems
  (PEP, due to Drori and Teboulle (2014)) and integral quadratic constraints (IQC,
  due to Lessard et al. (2016)), and relies on convex interpolation (due to Taylor
  et al. (2017c;b)).
