abstract: We present first massively parallel (MPC) algorithms and hardness of approximation
  results for computing Single-Linkage Clustering of n input d-dimensional vectors
  under Hamming, $\ell_1, \ell_2$ and $\ell_∞$ distances. All our algorithms run in
  O(log n) rounds of MPC for any fixed d and achieve (1+ε)-approximation for all distances
  (except Hamming for which we show an exact algorithm).We also show constant-factor
  inapproximability results for o(\log n)-round algorithms under standard MPC hardness
  assumptions (for sufficiently large dimension depending on the distance used). Efficiency
  of implementation of our algorithms in Apache Spark is demonstrated through experiments
  on the largest available vector datasets from the UCI machine learning repository
  exhibiting speedups of several orders of magnitude.
