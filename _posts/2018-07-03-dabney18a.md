abstract: In this work, we build on recent advances in distributional reinforcement
  learning to give a generally applicable, flexible, and state-of-the-art distributional
  variant of DQN. We achieve this by using quantile regression to approximate the
  full quantile function for the state-action return distribution. By reparameterizing
  a distribution over the sample space, this yields an implicitly defined return distribution
  and gives rise to a large class of risk-sensitive policies. We demonstrate improved
  performance on the 57 Atari 2600 games in the ALE, and use our algorithmâ€™s implicitly
  defined distributions to study the effects of risk-sensitive policies in Atari games.
