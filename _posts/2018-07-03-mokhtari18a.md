abstract: In this paper, we showcase the interplay between discrete and continuous
  optimization in network-structured settings. We propose the first fully decentralized
  optimization method for a wide class of non-convex objective functions that possess
  a diminishing returns property. More specifically, given an arbitrary connected
  network and a global continuous submodular function, formed by a sum of local functions,
  we develop Decentralized Continuous Greedy (DCG), a message passing algorithm that
  converges to the tight $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor of the optimum global solution
  using only local computation and communication. We also provide strong convergence
  bounds as a function of network size and spectral characteristics of the underlying
  topology. Interestingly, DCG readily provides a simple recipe for decentralized
  discrete submodular maximization through the means of continuous relaxations. Formally,
  we demonstrate that by lifting the local discrete functions to continuous domains
  and using DCG as an interface we can develop a consensus algorithm that also achieves
  the tight $(1-1/e)$ approximation guarantee of the global discrete solution once
  a proper rounding scheme is applied.
