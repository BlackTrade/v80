abstract: Deep generative models have recently yielded encouraging results in producing
  subjectively realistic samples of complex data. Far less attention has been paid
  to making these generative models interpretable. In many scenarios, ranging from
  scientific applications to finance, the observed variables have a natural grouping.
  It is often of interest to understand systems of interaction amongst these groups,
  and latent factor models (LFMs) are an attractive approach. However, traditional
  LFMs are limited by assuming a linear correlation structure. We present an output
  interpretable VAE (oi-VAE) for grouped data that models complex, nonlinear latent-to-observed
  relationships. We combine a structured VAE comprised of group-specific generators
  with a sparsity-inducing prior. We demonstrate that oi-VAE yields meaningful notions
  of interpretability in the analysis of motion capture and MEG data. We further show
  that in these situations, the regularization inherent to oi-VAE can actually lead
  to improved generalization and learned generative processes.
