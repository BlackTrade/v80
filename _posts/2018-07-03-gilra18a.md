abstract: Learning weights in a spiking neural network with hidden neurons, using
  local, stable and online rules, to control non-linear body dynamics is an open problem.
  Here, we employ a supervised scheme, Feedback-based Online Local Learning Of Weights
  (FOLLOW), to train a heterogeneous network of spiking neurons with hidden layers,
  to control a two-link arm so as to reproduce a desired state trajectory. We show
  that the network learns an inverse model of the non-linear dynamics, i.e. it infers
  from state trajectory as input to the network, the continuous-time command that
  produced the trajectory. Connection weights are adjusted via a local plasticity
  rule that involves pre-synaptic firing and post-synaptic feedback of the error in
  the inferred command. We propose a network architecture, termed differential feedforward,
  and show that it gives a lower test error than other feedforward and recurrent architectures.
  We demonstrate the performance of the inverse model to control a two-link arm along
  a desired trajectory.
