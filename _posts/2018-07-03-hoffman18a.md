abstract: Domain adaptation is critical for success in new, unseen environments.Adversarial
  adaptation models have shown tremendous progress towards adapting to new environments
  by focusing either on discovering domain invariant representations or by mapping
  between unpaired image domains. While feature space methods are difficult to interpret
  and sometimes fail to capture pixel-level and low-level domain shifts, image space
  methods sometimes fail to incorporate high level semantic knowledge relevant for
  the end task.We propose a model which adapts between domains using both generative
  image space alignment and latent representation space alignment. Our approach, Cycle-Consistent
  Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CyCADA), guides transfer between domains according
  to a specific discriminatively trained task and avoids divergence by enforcing consistency
  of the relevant semantics before and after adaptation.We evaluate our method on
  a variety of visual recognition and prediction settings, including digit classification
  and semantic segmentation of road scenes, advancing state-of-the-art performance
  for unsupervised adaptation from synthetic to real world driving domains.
