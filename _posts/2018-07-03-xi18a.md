abstract: Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are a set of tools providing posterior
  distributions on the output of numerical methods. The use of these methods is usually
  motivated by the fact that they can represent our uncertainty due to incomplete/finite
  information about the continuous mathematical problem being approximated. In this
  paper, we demonstrate that this paradigm can provide additional advantages, such
  as the possibility of transferring information between several numerical methods.
  This allows users to represent uncertainty in a more faithful manner and, as a by-product,
  provide increased numerical efficiency. We propose the first such numerical method
  by extending the well-known Bayesian quadrature algorithm to the case where we are
  interested in computing the integral of several related functions. We then prove
  convergence rates for the method in the well-specified and misspecified cases, and
  demonstrate its efficiency in the context of multi-fidelity models for complex engineering
  systems and a problem of global illumination in computer graphics.
