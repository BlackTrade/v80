abstract: We address a generalization of change point detectionwith the purpose of
  detecting the changelocations and the levels of clusters of a piecewiseconstant
  signal. Our approach is to model itas a nonparametric penalized least square modelselection
  on a family of models indexed over thecollection of partitions of the design points
  andpropose a computationally efficient algorithm toapproximately solve it. Statistically,
  minimizingsuch a penalized criterion yields an approximationto the maximum a-posteriori
  probability(MAP) estimator. The criterion is then analyzedand an oracle inequality
  is derived usinga Gaussian concentration inequality. The oracleinequality is used
  to derive on one hand conditionsfor consistency and on the other hand anadaptive
  upper bound on the expected square riskof the estimator, which statistically motivates
  ourapproximation. Finally, we apply our algorithmto simulated data to experimentally
  validate thestatistical guarantees and illustrate its behavior.
