abstract: We address a generalization of change point detection with the purpose of
  detecting the change locations and the levels of clusters of a piecewise constant
  signal. Our approach is to model it as a nonparametric penalized least square model
  selection on a family of models indexed over the collection of partitions of the
  design points and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to approximately
  solve it. Statistically, minimizing such a penalized criterion yields an approximation
  to the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimator. The criterion is then analyzed
  and an oracle inequality is derived using a Gaussian concentration inequality. The
  oracle inequality is used to derive on one hand conditions for consistency and on
  the other hand an adaptive upper bound on the expected square risk of the estimator,
  which statistically motivates our approximation. Finally, we apply our algorithm
  to simulated data to experimentally validate the statistical guarantees and illustrate
  its behavior.
