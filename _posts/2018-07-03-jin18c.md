abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning algorithms that estimate state and state-action
  value functions have been shown to be effective in a variety of challenging domains,
  including learning control strategies from raw image pixels. However, algorithms
  that estimate state and state-action value functions typically assume a fully observed
  state and must compensate for partial observations by using finite length observation
  histories or recurrent networks. In this work, we propose a new deep reinforcement
  learning algorithm based on counterfactual regret minimization that iteratively
  updates an approximation to an advantage-like function and is robust to partially
  observed state. We demonstrate that this new algorithm can substantially outperform
  strong baseline methods on several partially observed reinforcement learning tasks:
  learning first-person 3D navigation in Doom and Minecraft, and acting in the presence
  of partially observed objects in Doom and Pong.'
