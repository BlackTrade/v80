abstract: Consider a large social network with possibly severe degree heterogeneity
  and mixed-memberships. We are interested in testing whether the network has only
  one community or there are more than one communities. The problem is known to be
  non-trivial, partially due to the presence of severe degree heterogeneity. We construct
  a class of test statistics using the numbers of short paths and short cycles, and
  the key to our approach is a general framework for canceling the effects of degree
  heterogeneity. The tests compare favorably with existing methods. We support our
  methods with careful analysis and numerical study with simulated data and a real
  data example.
