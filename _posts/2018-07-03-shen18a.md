abstract: Recently, the decentralized optimization problem is attracting growing attention.
  Most existing methods are deterministic with high per-iteration cost and have a
  convergence rate quadratically depending on the problem condition number. Besides,
  the dense communication is necessary to ensure the convergence even if the dataset
  is sparse. In this paper, we generalize the decentralized optimization problem to
  a monotone operator root finding problem, and propose a stochastic algorithm named
  DSBA that (1) converges geometrically with a rate linearly depending on the problem
  condition number, and (2) can be implemented using sparse communication only. Additionally,
  DSBA handles important learning problems like AUC-maximization which can not be
  tackled efficiently in the previous problem setting. Experiments on convex minimization
  and AUC-maximization validate the efficiency of our method.
