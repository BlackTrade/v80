abstract: Nearest neighbor search using random projection trees has recently been
  shown to achieve superior performance, in terms of better accuracy while retrieving
  less number of data points, compared to locality sensitive hashing based methods.
  However, to achieve acceptable nearest neighbor search accuracy for large scale
  applications, where number of data points and/or number of features can be very
  large, it requires users to maintain, store and search through large number of such
  independent random projection trees, which may be undesirable for many practical
  applications. To address this issue, in this paper we present different search strategies
  to improve nearest neighbor search performance of a single random projection tree.
  Our approach exploits properties of single and multiple random projections, which
  allows us to store meaningful auxiliary information at internal nodes of a random
  projection tree as well as to design priority functions to guide the search process
  that results in improved nearest neighbor search performance. Empirical results
  on multiple real world datasets show that our proposed method improves the search
  accuracy of a single tree compared to baseline methods.
