abstract: This paper first presents a theory for generative adversarial methodsthat
  does not rely on the traditional minimax formulation. It shows that with a strong
  discriminator, a good generator can be learned so thatthe KL divergence between
  the distributions of real data and generated data improves after each functional
  gradient step until it converges to zero. Based on the theory, we propose a new
  stable generative adversarial method.A theoretical insight into the original GAN
  from this new viewpoint is also provided. The experiments on image generation show
  the effectiveness of our new method.
